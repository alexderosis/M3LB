//  Central-moment collision for the conservative Allen-Cahn phase field.
//
//  De Rosis & Enan, Phys. Fluids 33, 043315 (2021), Sec. II.D -- "3D GMRT-LBM
//  for g_i", Eqs. (50)-(67). PhaseFieldBGK implements that paper's PHYSICS
//  (Sec. II.B: the equilibrium, tau_phi = M/cs2, the anti-diffusion source);
//  this implements its COLLISION, which is not BGK, and the difference is a
//  stability limit rather than a refinement.
//
//  WHY IT EXISTS. The mobility fixes the relaxation rate,
//
//      M = cs2 (1/omega_phi - 1/2)   =>   omega_phi = 1 / (M/cs2 + 1/2),
//
//  and the Peclet number of an interface-capture test fixes the mobility,
//  Pe = U0 xi / M. So a high Peclet number is a low mobility is omega_phi -> 2,
//  which is the BGK stability edge, and there is nothing to trade against it:
//  BGK relaxes EVERY moment at that same rate, ghost modes included. Measured:
//  the Zalesak disk of the paper's Sec. III B runs at Pe = 80 (omega = 1.9910)
//  and reaches 1e300 at Pe = 400 (omega = 1.9982). The paper's own sweep goes to
//  Pe = 4000, and it gets there because only its FIRST-order moments carry
//  omega_phi -- everything else is sent straight to equilibrium.
//
//  THE SCHEME, and why it comes out so short. The relaxation matrix is
//
//      K_phi = diag[1, omega_phi, omega_phi, omega_phi, 1, 1, ... 1]         (55)
//
//  in central moments: the zeroth is conserved, the three first-order ones
//  relax at omega_phi and set the mobility, and every higher moment is
//  overwritten with its equilibrium value each step. The paper lists those
//  equilibrium central moments in the MONOMIAL basis and finds five nonzero
//  ones -- k0 = phi, k4 = phi, k16 = k17 = k18 = phi cs^4 (Eq. 54). ProductBasis
//  here uses the SHIFTED basis, phi_2 = C^2 - cs2, in which those five collapse:
//
//      k4'  = k4 - 3 cs2 k0                     = phi - phi        = 0,
//      k16' = k16 - cs2 k_xx - cs2 k_yy + cs4 k0
//           = phi cs4 - phi cs4 - phi cs4 + phi cs4                 = 0,
//
//  so in this basis the equilibrium is simply
//
//      k^eq = (phi, 0, 0, ..., 0),
//
//  which is the same statement the fluid operator's banner makes about the
//  product-form Maxwellian being diagonal here. That is worth pausing on: it
//  means the whole collision is "keep phi, damp the three first moments, zero
//  everything else", and no equilibrium table is needed at all.
//
//  THE SOURCE. The anti-diffusion term has sum_i S_i = 0 and
//  sum_i c_i S_i = cs2 (1 - omega/2) theta n, so in central moments it touches
//  only the three first-order slots -- its zeroth moment vanishes and, being
//  first order in c, its central and raw first moments differ by u times its
//  zeroth, which is zero. It is therefore added to k1..k3 directly, with the
//  same (1 - omega/2) prefactor PhaseFieldBGK derives and for the same reason:
//  this source enters the ZEROTH-moment equation through the divergence of the
//  first moment, so it contributes twice and the coefficient is 1/omega, not
//  Guo's 1/(1 - omega/2). That derivation is in PhaseFieldBGK's banner and is
//  not repeated; what matters here is that the two operators use the identical
//  source, so any difference between them is the collision and nothing else.
//
//  WHAT IT COSTS. Two three-pass transforms per node against BGK's single loop.
//
//  A RETRACTION, AND IT MATTERS BECAUSE IT WAS THE CLAIM THIS OPERATOR WAS
//  JUSTIFIED BY. An earlier version of this banner reported that the operator
//  completes De Rosis & Enan's Table III at Pe = 80, 400, 800 and 4000 where
//  BGK reaches 1e300 on the last three, and read that as a stability ceiling
//  the central-moment form lifts. The Peclet number had been read as
//  Pe = U0 xi / M, which is what their paper's text says. Their drivers all
//  compute
//
//      M = U_ref * d / Pe
//
//  with d the DOMAIN SIZE. On Table III at Pe = 80 that is M = 0.0497 and
//  omega = 1.54; the interface-width reading gives M = 7.5e-4 and omega =
//  1.991. So BGK was being run 66 times short of mobility, hard against the
//  stability edge, and it diverged for that reason and not because of anything
//  intrinsic to BGK at their operating point. ACROSS EVERY CASE IN THE PAPER
//  THEIR OMEGA NEVER EXCEEDS 1.988.
//
//  The comparison is being rerun at their mobilities. Until it lands, this
//  operator has NO measured advantage over PhaseFieldBGK recorded here, and
//  the numbers previously tabulated in this banner -- the mobility ladder and
//  the cycle scan -- describe a regime the paper does not visit. They were
//  real measurements of the wrong thing.
//
//  PRODUCT LATTICES ONLY. The transform is three one-dimensional passes, which
//  needs the velocity set to be a tensor product: D2Q9 and D3Q27, not D2Q5 or
//  D3Q7. Pair this with PhaseFieldBGK on the reduced lattices.

  // WHY THE SOURCE IS THREE TERMS HERE AND NINE IN THE PAPER. Their Eq. (61)
  // lists nine nonzero entries -- R_{1,2,3} = F and, at third order,
  // R10 = R15 = F_y cs2, R11 = R13 = F_x cs2, R12 = R14 = F_z cs2 -- and it is
  // tempting to read that as six slots missing from the three lines above.
  // They are not missing; they are zero in THIS basis. Eq. (61) is written in
  // the monomial CMs, whereas ProductBasis is shifted, phi_2 = C^2 - cs2, so
  // the (a,a,b) slot is (C_a^2 - cs2) C_b and the same source contributes
  //
  //     cs4 A_b  -  cs2 * cs2 A_b  =  0
  //
  // to every one of the six. tests/test_phase_field.cpp block 8 checks both
  // halves of that -- the raw moments reproduce their Eq. (61) exactly, and
  // the shifted ones outside the first three are 4e-20 -- because the trap is
  // live in both directions: adding the six here would double-count them, and
  // dropping them from a monomial implementation would lose them.
  //
  // THAT CANCELLATION IS AT u = 0, and the qualifier matters. Transform S_i at
  // a general velocity and 26 of the 27 shifted moments are nonzero, not 3;
  // the sparsity is a property of the rest frame. Their drivers add a
  // u-INDEPENDENT source and so does this, so both truncate the source's
  // central moments at u = 0 -- a shared approximation rather than an
  // identity, and MATLAB/D3Q27_CM_phase.m prints both so the difference stays
  // visible. The cost is O(|u| A) in the higher slots, which is the same order
  // as the O(|u|^3) equilibrium gap against BGK that block 6 measures.
  //
  // THE cs2 IS NOT DECORATION. PhaseFieldBGK adds S_i = (1 - omega/2) w_i
  // (c_i . A) to the populations, whose first moment is (1 - omega/2) cs2 A
  // because sum_i w_i c_ia c_ib = cs2 delta_ab. Writing A here without the cs2
  // makes the anti-diffusion three times too weak on a cs2 = 1/3 lattice, which
  // does not blow up and does not look wrong: the interface simply spreads, the
  // way PhaseFieldBGK's banner records W = 4 becoming 14.1 in 600 steps when
  // the same term was got wrong the other way. Block 5 pins it by predicting
  // the post-collision first moment and contracting for it.
