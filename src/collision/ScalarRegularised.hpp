//==============================================================================
//  REGULARISED advection-diffusion collision for a passive scalar.
//
//  Same physics as ScalarBGK -- same equilibrium, same diffusivity, same
//  interface -- and one difference that only matters near omega = 2: it relaxes
//  the FLUX moments at omega and sends the ghost moments straight to
//  equilibrium, instead of relaxing everything at omega.
//
//  ================== WHY BGK IS NOT ENOUGH NEAR omega = 2 ===================
//  D3Q7 carries seven moments: the scalar T, the three fluxes j_a, and three
//  ghosts (the axial second moments). Only the first four have physical content
//  -- T is conserved and j_a sets the diffusive flux, so it must relax at the
//  rate that fixes alpha. The ghosts carry nothing, and what happens to them is
//  a free choice.
//
//  BGK relaxes them at omega too. At omega = 1 that is projection onto
//  equilibrium and the two operators are IDENTICAL. As omega -> 2 it becomes a
//  REFLECTION: the post-collision ghost is (1 - omega) times the pre-collision
//  one, so at omega = 1.997 it is multiplied by -0.997 every step. It inverts
//  and never damps.
//
//  MEASURED, and this is why the operator exists. At Ra = 1e14
//  (omega_T = 1.99999905) the near-wall temperature under BGK RINGS rather than
//  relaxing: GPU/'s twin of this driver saw Nu_bot swing 34.9 <-> 93.6 over
//  sixty free-fall times against an analytic ~100 -- bounded rather than
//  diverging, which is the dangerous kind of wrong, because it averages into a
//  plausible number. The same mechanism sets how far a cold-start initial
//  condition undershoots its own lower bound: worst T_min, cold start,
//
//      ScalarBGK       Ra = 1e10  -0.552     Ra = 1e14  -0.813
//      this operator   Ra = 1e14  -0.112, and it RECOVERS
//
//  against a physical floor of T_cold = 0. The maximum principle is not a
//  detail here: a scheme that leaves [T_cold, T_hot] is not solving the problem
//  that was posed, so a fifth of the excursion is the difference between a run
//  that can be quoted and one that cannot.
//
//  THE INVERSE IS CLOSED-FORM, not a transform. On these lattices every
//  velocity has one nonzero component and the axes decouple, so with
//
//      M_a = sum_i h_i c_ia^2 = cs2 dT   (the ghost, at equilibrium)
//      p_a = j_a + omega (T u_a - j_a)   (the flux, relaxed)
//
//  the pair along axis a is just (M_a +/- p_a)/2 and the rest population is
//  whatever is left of dT. No matrix, no basis, seven multiplies. That is also
//  why this is NOT a moment operator in the sense of MomentCollision.hpp and
//  needs none of its machinery -- and, per the warning in that file's
//  eq_moment banner, no runtime-indexed moment array either.
//
//  WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not more accurate in the hydrodynamic limit: the
//  ghosts do not appear in the advection-diffusion equation the scheme
//  recovers, so at moderate omega the two operators agree to the same order and
//  ScalarBGK remains the simpler default for those cases. It changes the
//  STABILITY and the boundedness near omega = 2, nothing else. Below about
//  omega = 1.9 there is no reason to prefer it.
//
//  It also does not fix the underlying resolution problem. omega -> 2 means
//  alpha -> 0, which means the thermal boundary layer is thinner than the cell
//  that has to represent it; annihilating the ghosts stops that from RINGING
//  but does not resolve the layer. See the Nu ceiling of H/2 in
//  demonstrator/rb_high_ra.cpp.
//
//  Interface, storage reference, per-node omega, omega_from_diffusivity: all
//  inherited from ScalarBGK unchanged. Only `collide` differs.
