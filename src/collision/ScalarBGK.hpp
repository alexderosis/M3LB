//  Advection-diffusion collision for a passive scalar (temperature).
//
//  Differs from the fluid operators in one structural way: the velocity is an
//  INPUT, not something recovered from its own populations. The scalar carries
//  only its own zeroth moment,
//
//      T = sum_i g_i,
//
//  and is advected by whatever velocity field the fluid solver hands it. That is
//  why this has its own collision concept rather than reusing `Macro`.
//
//  Equilibrium: g_i^eq = w_i T (1 + c_i.u / cs2), first order in u.
//
//  That truncation is deliberate. D2Q5 and D3Q7 have an isotropic second moment
//  but NOT an isotropic fourth-order one, and on D3Q7 every velocity has a single
//  nonzero component, so (c.u)^2 reduces to c_a^2 u_a^2 and the cross terms of
//  the uu tensor cannot be represented at all. Adding a second-order term would
//  therefore add an anisotropic error rather than accuracy. The cost is an O(u^2)
//  defect in the advection term, which is why these lattices suit low-Mach
//  transport -- exactly the regime Boussinesq convection lives in.
//
//  Diffusivity: D = cs^2 (1/omega - 1/2), with cs2 = 1/4 on D3Q7 and 1/3 on D2Q5.
//
//  STORAGE REFERENCE. The arrays hold h_i = g_i - w_i T_ref, for the same reason
//  the fluid stores f_i - w_i: the collision works on differences far smaller
//  than the populations themselves, and in FP32 that cancellation costs most of
//  the mantissa. Unlike the fluid, though, there is no universal reference --
//  rho is always near 1, but a temperature scale is whatever the problem says it
//  is. So T_ref is a runtime parameter, and leaving it at its default of 0
//  reproduces the unshifted scheme exactly. Set it to the mean temperature.
//
//  CONJUGATE HEAT TRANSFER: a per-node relaxation rate.
//
//  `omega_of` is an optional field of relaxation rates. Leave it empty (the
//  default) and every node uses the scalar `omega`; fill it and the diffusivity
//  becomes a property of the node, which is what a solid inclusion in a fluid
//  needs. The two are never mixed: omega_of, once set, is authoritative
//  everywhere, so a partially filled field is a silent zero-diffusivity bug and
//  not a supported state.
//
//  WHAT THIS MODELS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Varying omega alone varies the
//  diffusivity alpha = lambda / (rho c_p). It therefore reproduces a
//  conductivity ratio ONLY where rho c_p is uniform, because the scheme
//  transports sum_i g_i and that sum is the temperature, not the enthalpy.
//  validation/zhou_thermal.cpp's conduction case is the uniform-rho-c_p kind,
//  which is also what Zhou et al. (2026) Sec. 3.1 specifies.
//
//  A jump in volumetric heat capacity needs a different variable, and since
//  2026-09-21 that variable exists: collision/EnthalpyBGK.hpp transports the
//  total enthalpy H = e(T) + La f_l and handles melting, solidification and a
//  capacity jump. Use it rather than reaching for omega_of here.
//
//  WHY omega_of CANNOT BE MADE TO DO IT, since it is the first thing anyone
//  tries. Melting by an apparent heat capacity sets alpha = k/(rho c_app(T))
//  with c_app carrying the latent heat over a narrow band. But BGK conserves
//  sum_i g_i LOCALLY for any omega field -- sum_i g_i^eq = T identically,
//  because sum_i w_i c_i = 0 -- so the conserved integral is the integral of T
//  and the latent heat is simply not in the budget. No choice of omega can
//  remove heat from the transported variable when a cell melts. Equivalently,
//  div(alpha grad T) = (1/rho c_app) div(k grad T) + k grad T . grad(1/rho
//  c_app), and the second term is the same order as the first and is set by a
//  physical band width, so it does not refine away.
//
//  The interface condition is not imposed anywhere -- continuity of T and of
//  alpha dT/dn emerges from the streaming, with the effective interface sitting
//  midway between the last node of one material and the first of the other.
//  That is second-order accurate and NOT exact: validation/zhou_thermal.cpp
//  measures what it costs (0.11% at kappa = 100 and N = 400, falling as N^-2).
