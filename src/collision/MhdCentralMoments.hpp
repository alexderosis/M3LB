//  NOT THE DEFAULT ANY MORE, AND KEPT ON PURPOSE. Since 2026-09-17 the tree's
//  MHD operator is MhdCentralMomentsShifted: shifted (Hermite) basis, phi_2 =
//  C^2 - cs^2, where K_F has exactly THREE non-zeros (a_x, a_y, a_z at first
//  order) instead of being spread across the third-order slots by hand. Every
//  physics driver defaults to it -- mhd_sphere, mhd_decay, mhd_cylinder and
//  hartmann_inlet all take -op cms unless told otherwise.
//
//  This operator stays for the two things the shifted one cannot be:
//    * the LITERAL reproduction of the paper below. tests/test_moments.cpp pins
//      Eq. (8) and Eq. (11) term by term, validation/cmcheck.cpp pins the
//      documented 3-D equilibrium moments (doc eq:cm3dho), and
//      validation/orszag_tang{,_3d}.cpp reproduce that paper's own figures with
//      that paper's own scheme. Migrating those would change what is being
//      reproduced, which is the one thing a reproduction may not do.
//    * the CONTRAST that justifies the shifted basis. validation/forcing_cm.cpp
//      holds K_F for the MONOMIAL operators and the second-order truncation
//      ladder (HighOrder = false, which the shifted operator has no switch for);
//      those rows are the evidence that K_F collapses to three non-zeros.
//
//  THE TWO ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE, AND THE SIZE OF THE GAP DEPENDS ON THE FLOW.
//  Beyond the basis change they differ in the EQUILIBRIUM: Eq. (11) carries
//  hydrodynamic Galilean defects at orders 3 and 4 which the shifted form does
//  not, and that difference does NOT vanish at omega_bulk = 1 (the omega_bulk
//  term is only the k_22 basis artefact). Measured 2026-09-17:
//    * hartmann_inlet, steady and near-unidirectional -- IDENTICAL to every
//      printed digit, relL2 2.28102e-02 / 5.39096e-03 / 1.28554e-03 /
//      3.07103e-04 and orders 2.081 / 2.068 / 2.066 either way.
//    * orszag_tang_3d at M = 32, turbulent -- up to 10 % in E(t) and 6.8 % in
//      J_max. Orders 3 and 4 matter there and the two schemes part company.
//  So "swap the operator" is safe for a smooth steady flow and is a physics
//  change for a turbulent one. Do not assume; measure, as above.

//  Hybrid central-moment MHD collision for D2Q9, after
//
//    A. De Rosis, E. Leveque, R. Chahine, "Advanced lattice Boltzmann scheme for
//    high-Reynolds-number magneto-hydrodynamic flows", J. Turbulence 19(6) 2018,
//    Equations (7)-(13).
//
//  Central moments are taken in the paper's non-orthogonal basis (its Eq. 8),
//
//    t0 = 1        t1 = Cx       t2 = Cy       t3 = Cx^2 + Cy^2
//    t4 = Cx^2 - Cy^2            t5 = Cx Cy    t6 = Cx^2 Cy
//    t7 = Cx Cy^2                t8 = Cx^2 Cy^2,        C = c - u,
//
//  which is the monomial central-moment set with the two normal stresses written
//  as their sum and difference. Note this is NOT the shifted basis used by
//  MomentCollision: there phi_2 = C^2 - cs^2, chosen because it diagonalises the
//  product-form equilibrium. Here the equilibrium is the paper's, so the paper's
//  basis is used and the transform is written out directly.
//
//  EQUILIBRIUM (Eq. 11). These are the central moments of the SECOND-ORDER
//  truncated equilibrium plus the Maxwell term of Eq. (1) -- not of a
//  product-form equilibrium. That is why the hydrodynamic parts are nonzero at
//  third and fourth order: -rho ux^2 uy in k6 and 3 rho ux^2 uy^2 in k8 are
//  exactly the Galilean defects of the truncation, and reproducing the paper
//  means reproducing them rather than "improving" them away.
//
//  RELAXATION (Eq. 12): k*_i = k_i + omega_i (k_i^eq - k_i) for i = 3..8, with
//  omega_4 = omega_5 = omega_v setting the viscosity, omega_3 the bulk
//  viscosity, and omega_6 = omega_7 = omega_8 = 1 sending the ghost moments
//  straight to equilibrium. k0, k1, k2 are collision invariants.
//
//  Storage is raw. The paper's scheme is defined on f itself, and the shifted
//  variant would need the weight moments carried through Eq. (11); that is a
//  separate exercise from reproducing the published scheme.

  // Guo's force expands in monomial central moments as
  //     K_F = [0, F_x, F_y, 0, 0, 0, cs^2 F_y, cs^2 F_x, 0]
  // in the ordering (00,10,01,20,02,11,21,12,22).
  //
  // What a CENTRAL operator gets for free is the order-2 block: the generic
  // form carries (1 - omega/2)(F_a du_b + F_b du_a) with du = u - u_basis, and
  // for central moments u_basis IS u, so du vanishes identically and the whole
  // second-order contribution with it. That argument is sound and is why the
  // order-2 lines below carry no force term.
  //
  // THE THIRD-ORDER PAIR IS A DIFFERENT MATTER, AND UNTIL 2026-09-15 THIS
  // OPERATOR SIMPLY DROPPED IT. The original code deferred to
  // MomentCollision.hpp's argument that putting the force in the first-order
  // slot alone already delivers k_21 = cs^2 F_y "for free". Read that argument:
  // it is explicitly conditioned on ITS basis being Hermite, phi_2 = C^2 - cs^2,
  // so that k_21(monomial) = k_21(Hermite) + cs^2 k_01(Hermite) and the cs^2
  // comes out of the basis function. THIS basis is the plain monomial one --
  // said twice above, at the header note and at fwd/inv -- so nothing is
  // carried and nothing is delivered. Transcribing a moment list from one basis
  // into another is the trap CLAUDE.md names under "A published moment list
  // belongs to a basis", and this was an instance of it.
  //
  // The coefficient is (1 - omega_6/2) K_21 with omega_6 = 1, i.e. cs^2 F / 2,
  // which is F/6 on D2Q9. Three routes agree on it: the mode-wise (I - Lambda/2)
  // rule; the Hermite identity above evaluated at the POST-collision first
  // moment, k_21(monomial) = k_21(Hermite)^eq + cs^2 (F/2), which is what
  // MomentCollision actually puts on the lattice in a run; and MhdBGK's Guo
  // path, (1 - omega/2) cs^2 F, at omega = 1. So after this fix the two
  // central-moment operators agree exactly and MhdBGK agrees at omega = 1.
  //
  // WHY NO TEST SAW IT. The omitted term is a divergence: it cancels for a
  // UNIFORM force and is O(F) only where the force varies within a cell, which
  // is precisely what a penalisation layer is. demonstrator/mhd_decay.cpp
  // -fcheck is a uniform force in a periodic box measured on momentum, so it
  // could not see it; tests/test_moments.cpp instantiates this operator with
  // NoForcing. validation/forcing_cm.cpp now covers it directly, in both bases,
  // and reverting these two lines takes it from 7.1e-13 to 1.67e-01 = cs^2/2 --
  // i.e. the whole term, since nothing else was supplying it.
  //
  // AND HOW MUCH IT WAS WORTH, because "required" and "large" are not the same
  // claim. Measured on `-regime 1 -n 161 -steps 4000`, the penalised case this
  // operator was written for: the worst relative change across every reported
  // column is 4.8e-4, at the divergence diagnostic. So the term is necessary for
  // the operator to be its own documented scheme and to agree with its sibling,
  // and it is NOT what stands between this case and the reference. It relaxes at
  // omega_6 = 1 and enters the recovered hydrodynamics as an error term, so a
  // thin penalisation layer is not enough leverage to move the bulk integrals.
  // Do not quote this fix as a change in any regime result.
  //
  // The half-force convention does the rest. `macroscopic` reports
  // u = (sum c f + F/2)/rho, so the PRE-collision first central moment is
  // -F/2; the post-collision value must be +F/2, which is why the line below
  // writes F/2 where the unforced operator writes zero. Getting that factor
  // wrong is a silent 2x in the force and is exactly what the momentum
  // identity in -fcheck exists to catch -- and does catch.
