//  Conservative Allen-Cahn collision for the phase field.
//
//  Tracks an order parameter phi in [0, 1] -- 1 in the heavy phase, 0 in the
//  light one -- obeying
//
//      d_t phi + div(phi u) = div[ M ( grad phi - theta n ) ],
//      theta = (4/W) phi (1 - phi),      n = grad phi / |grad phi|,
//
//  whose one-dimensional equilibrium is EXACTLY the hyperbolic tangent
//
//      phi(x) = 1/2 [ 1 + tanh(2x/W) ],
//
//  because for that profile |grad phi| = (4/W) phi (1 - phi) identically, so the
//  diffusive and anti-diffusive fluxes cancel term for term. That is the whole
//  point of the conservative form: the interface neither spreads nor sharpens,
//  and W is a prescribed number of lattice units rather than something that
//  emerges from a balance and has to be measured afterwards.
//
//  FOLLOWS De Rosis & Enan, Phys. Fluids 33, 043315 (2021), Sec. II.B: Eq. (9)
//  for the relaxation, Eq. (11) for the equilibrium, Eq. (13) for tau_phi = M/cs2,
//  Eqs. (15)-(16) for the source and Eq. (20) for the gradient. The source below
//  was derived independently and then checked against Eqs. (15)-(16); they agree
//  term for term, which is worth recording because getting it wrong is silent
//  (see THE SOURCE, below).
//
//  RELATION TO ScalarBGK. Structurally this is that operator plus one source
//  term. Velocity is an INPUT and the only moment carried is the zeroth,
//  phi = sum_i h_i.
//
//  THE EQUILIBRIUM IS A POLICY, because the right truncation depends on the
//  lattice and this operator is meant to run on both kinds:
//
//    * On a Navier-Stokes lattice (D2Q9, D3Q27) the default is the
//      SECOND-ORDER form, which is Eq. (11) of the reference exactly -- and it
//      is the fluid's own equilibrium with phi substituted for rho, so
//      SecondOrderEquilibrium is reused rather than retyped. The paper runs the
//      phase field on the full Navier-Stokes lattice alongside the flow.
//    * On D2Q5 / D3Q7 the default drops to FIRST order, because those lattices
//      have no isotropic fourth-order moment; on D3Q7 every velocity has a
//      single nonzero component, so (c.u)^2 collapses to c_a^2 u_a^2 and the
//      cross terms of uu cannot be represented at all. A second-order term
//      there adds anisotropy, not accuracy -- the same argument ScalarBGK makes.
//
//  The trade is cost against advection accuracy: the reduced lattice moves 5 or
//  7 populations against 9 or 19, and pays an O(u^2) defect in the advection
//  term. A static interface cannot see that difference; a sheared one can.
//
//  THE SOURCE, AND WHY ITS PREFACTOR IS NOT GUO'S.
//
//  Chapman-Enskog on the advection-diffusion LBE with a source S_i obeying
//  sum_i S_i = 0 and sum_i c_i S_i = A_S gives
//
//      d_t phi + div(phi u) = M lap(phi) - (1/omega) div(A_S),
//
//  so matching the anti-diffusion term needs
//
//      A_S = omega M theta n = cs2 (1 - omega/2) theta n,
//
//  using omega M = cs2 (1 - omega/2). With S_i = w_i (c_i . A_S) / cs2 the cs2
//  cancels and the source is simply
//
//      S_i = (1 - omega/2) theta w_i (c_i . n),
//
//  carrying no mobility and no speed of sound at all. sum_i S_i = 0, so phi is
//  conserved exactly -- that is the "conservative" in conservative Allen-Cahn.
//
//  The coefficient is 1/omega, NOT the 1/(1 - omega/2) that Guo's force term
//  compensates, and the difference is structural rather than a convention. A
//  body force enters the FIRST-moment equation directly, where the half-step
//  correction is absorbed by redefining the velocity. This enters the ZEROTH-
//  moment equation through the divergence of the first moment, so the source
//  contributes twice -- once through h^(1) and once through the second-order
//  Taylor term -- and (1/omega - 1/2) + 1/2 = 1/omega is where that lands.
//
//  Getting this wrong is not subtle in its effect but is silent in its cause:
//  with the Guo prefactor and a 1/cs2 the source comes out a factor
//  M/cs2 = 1/omega - 1/2 too small, the anti-diffusion cannot balance the
//  diffusion, and the interface simply spreads as though the term were absent.
//  Measured before the fix: W = 4 became 14.1 in 600 steps, against the
//  sqrt(4 M t) = 11 of pure diffusion.
//
//  CHECK. At a static flat interface the total flux M grad phi - M theta n must
//  vanish pointwise, which is exactly the tanh identity |grad phi| = theta.
//
//  MOBILITY. M = cs^2 (1/omega - 1/2), exactly as the diffusivity in ScalarBGK,
//  with cs2 = 1/3 on D2Q5 and 1/4 on D3Q7. It is a numerical parameter, not a
//  physical one: too small and the interface cannot heal after being advected
//  through the grid, too large and it diffuses faster than the flow deforms it.
//  M in [0.01, 0.1] is the usual working range.
//
//  NO STORAGE SHIFT. phi is O(1) and its useful range is exactly [0, 1], so
//  there is no cancellation to protect against -- unlike the fluid, where the
//  populations are O(w_i) and the collision works on differences many orders
//  smaller. RawPopulations is not a placeholder here, it is the right answer.
