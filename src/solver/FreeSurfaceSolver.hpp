//  Free-surface flow: a sharp interface, and only the liquid.
//
//  THE THIRD ROUTE TO A MULTIPHASE FLOW IN THIS CODE, and the one that changes
//  the bargain rather than the parameters. PhaseFieldSolver.hpp and
//  ColourGradientSolver.hpp both resolve BOTH fluids, and everything difficult
//  about them follows from that: the pressure-gauge conditioning at a density
//  ratio, the alpha interpolation, the recolouring. This one does not resolve
//  the gas at all. The gas is a VOID held at a prescribed pressure -- it has no
//  populations, no velocity and no dynamics -- and the liquid meets it across a
//  boundary condition rather than across a diffuse interface.
//
//  What that buys is the thing the other two fight for. There is no density
//  ratio here because there is no second density: the ratio is infinite by
//  construction, and it costs nothing, because the expensive half of the problem
//  was deleted rather than discretised. It is the standard tool for violent
//  free-surface flow -- dam break, sloshing, filling, splashing -- and it is
//  useless for anything where the gas does work: a rising bubble, a driven
//  gas-liquid shear layer, anything with a Weber number the gas participates in.
//
//      module            interface   fluids resolved   density ratio
//      phase field       diffuse     both              ~100, with the gauge problem
//      colour gradient   diffuse     both              1000 in principle
//      free surface      sharp       liquid only       infinite, by construction
//
//  PROVENANCE, STATED PLAINLY. This follows the standard formulation of Korner,
//  Thies, Hofmann, Theobald & Rude, J. Stat. Phys. 121, 179 (2005), and the
//  refinements in Thurey's and Rude's later work. Unlike the colour-gradient
//  module there is no paper in SomeRefs/ to check equation by equation, so
//  nothing here cites an equation number and every choice below is justified
//  from the mechanics rather than by reference. Where the literature offers a
//  refinement this code does not implement, it says so.
//
//==============================================================================
//  THE STATE. Every cell is Gas, Interface or Fluid (or a wall, or halo). Fluid
//  cells are ordinary LBM cells. Gas cells hold nothing. Interface cells are the
//  entire method: they carry an explicit MASS m alongside their populations, and
//  a fill level
//
//      epsilon = m / rho,
//
//  which is 1 when the cell is full and 0 when it is empty. The interface is a
//  closed, one-cell-thick shell separating Fluid from Gas, and keeping it closed
//  through arbitrary topology change is most of the work.
//
//  MASS IS ADVECTED, NOT A MOMENT, and that is the sharpest difference from
//  everything else in this tree. Elsewhere density is sum_i f_i and conservation
//  is a property of the collision operator, checkable by algebra. Here mass moves
//  because populations cross faces, and the exchange between two cells is
//
//      dm_i(x) = f_ibar(x + c_i) - f_i(x)          both cells Fluid or Interface,
//
//  scaled by the mean fill level when both are Interface, because a half-full
//  cell can only exchange half as much. Nothing enforces conservation but the
//  antisymmetry of that expression: what x sends to its neighbour is exactly
//  what the neighbour receives from x. That is why validation checks total mass
//  to round-off first and everything else second -- it is the one property that
//  can be silently lost.
//
//  THE FREE-SURFACE CONDITION reconstructs the populations that would have
//  arrived from the gas. For every direction i whose source cell x - c_i is Gas,
//
//      f_i(x) = f_i^eq(rho_G, u) + f_ibar^eq(rho_G, u) - f_ibar(x),
//
//  with rho_G fixing the gas pressure through p = rho_G cs^2. Its two moments
//  are what the free surface is: the normal stress equals the gas pressure, and
//  the tangential stress vanishes. f_ibar(x) here is the post-collision
//  population at x from the previous step, which the two-lattice scheme still
//  holds in its source array -- no extra storage is needed to find it.
//
//  THE VELOCITY IN THAT RECONSTRUCTION IS ONE STEP OLD. u is needed to build the
//  equilibria, and u comes from a sum over the populations, some of which are
//  the ones being reconstructed. The circle is broken with the previous step's
//  velocity, which is first-order in time and is what the literature does. It
//  matters where the interface accelerates hard; it is invisible in a standing
//  wave.
//
//==============================================================================
//  WHY TWO-LATTICE STREAMING, when everything else in this code uses Esoteric
//  Pull. Three requirements, and Esoteric Pull fails two of them outright.
//
//   1. Mass exchange needs f_i(x) and f_ibar(x + c_i) as POST-COLLISION values,
//      after the whole domain has collided. Under an in-place scheme those slots
//      hold a mixture of two time levels, and which one depends on parity and on
//      the direction's index. Under two-lattice they are simply the destination
//      array, complete and unambiguous, once the collide pass has fenced.
//   2. A cell that fills up turns its gas neighbours into interface cells, which
//      then need populations. In place, a cell's populations live in its
//      neighbours' slots -- initialising a neighbour means writing storage that
//      other cells are concurrently reading through their own aliases.
//   3. Reading a neighbour's post-collision state while writing one's own is the
//      normal case here and impossible there.
//
//  Requirement 2 is dodged rather than met: every pass below is a GATHER. A cell
//  that is about to become interface initialises ITSELF by averaging its
//  neighbours, and a cell with excess mass to give away publishes it in a field
//  that its neighbours collect. Nothing ever writes another cell's memory, so
//  there is no race to reason about and no atomics. That is a deliberate shape,
//  not an accident of the streaming choice -- it would be worth keeping even if
//  scatters were free.
//
//  The cost is two population arrays instead of one. For a method that deletes
//  an entire phase, that is not the expensive part.
//
//==============================================================================
//  WHAT THIS DOES NOT MODEL.
//
//   * NO SURFACE TENSION -- STILL, BUT THE REASON HAS NARROWED. It used to be
//     that rho_G was uniform, so the gas pressure could carry no curvature term
//     at all. rho_G_of (below) makes the gas pressure a FIELD, so the normal
//     stress can now vary from node to node, and p_G = p_atm - sigma kappa is
//     expressible. WHAT IS STILL MISSING IS kappa: nothing here computes a
//     curvature from the fill level, and that is the hard half. So surface
//     tension is not present, a caller that wants it must supply the curvature
//     itself, and everything at a Bond number where surface tension competes
//     with gravity remains out of scope -- most droplet problems, and none of
//     the dam-break family. What rho_G_of DOES deliver on its own is a
//     prescribed non-uniform normal stress, which is a laser's recoil pressure:
//     validation/recoil.cpp measures that against the exact hydrostatic
//     depression.
//   * NO GAS DYNAMICS, and this is the method, not an omission. An enclosed
//     bubble does not compress, because its pressure is prescribed rather than
//     solved. Modelling that needs a volume-of-gas tracker with a separate
//     bubble-merging graph, which is a larger piece of work than this file.
//   * THE RECONSTRUCTION IS APPLIED TO GAS-FACING DIRECTIONS ONLY. The
//     literature also reconstructs directions with c_i . n > 0 for the interface
//     normal n, which stabilises interfaces that are nearly tangential to the
//     lattice. That refinement is not here, and if a case shows interface
//     roughening along a diagonal this is the first thing to add.
//   * EXCESS MASS IS REDISTRIBUTED UNIFORMLY among eligible neighbours rather
//     than weighted by the interface normal. Uniform redistribution conserves
//     mass exactly -- which is what matters most -- but is known to be more
//     diffusive at a sharply curved interface than the normal-weighted form.
//   * NO SUBGRID INTERFACE. The interface is resolved to one cell, so a film
//     thinner than a cell either survives as a one-cell layer or vanishes.
//   * A MOVING OBSTACLE IS BETTER THAN IT WAS AND STILL NOT RELIABLE. What this
//     entry used to say -- that mass_exchange()'s per-face antisymmetry is
//     broken by the mask changing between passes -- was WRONG, and measuring it
//     is what showed so: summed over a sweeping body, the interface-interface
//     term of mass_exchange() is 0.000000 to every digit. flags_ is fixed for
//     the whole of that pass and both cells of every pair do agree on it.
//
//     What was actually wrong, and is now fixed, is that
//     transfer_covered_mass() chose its recipients by reading reinit_. Nothing
//     clears reinit_ between settle() at the end of one step and
//     transfer_covered_mass() early in the next, so interface cells that
//     settle() had just built out of gas counted as cells this body had
//     uncovered. The share was divided among more cells than the body exposed,
//     the genuinely uncovered ones came back too empty and converted to gas,
//     and the body dug a void in its own wake. On the isolated test in
//     tests/test_free_surface.cpp that was not a drift but a DIVERGENCE, to a
//     total of 7.7e28 by step 1200; it is now bounded at 6.0e-2.
//     water_entry_fs.cpp reaches t* = 8.86 against 6.16 before.
//
//     TWO FURTHER DEFECTS ARE IDENTIFIED, MEASURED, AND DELIBERATELY NOT FIXED,
//     which is a worse-sounding sentence than it is. Both are real:
//
//       (i)  placing the body covers cells and uncovers none, and the early
//            return below then abandons their mass -- 49 of 1175 units, 4%, on
//            the first call of the isolated test. The same happens on any step
//            whose discretised outline covers without uncovering, which for a
//            body moving less than a cell per step is most of them.
//       (ii) settle() keeps the WHOLE mass of a cell whose conversion promote()
//            afterwards overruled, while classify() has already published that
//            cell's excess and settle() has already handed it to the
//            neighbours. It creates mass, exactly the published amount, and it
//            fires wherever a filling cell sits beside an emptying one: +25.0
//            units in a single step of the isolated test.
//
//     Each was fixed, and each fix made water_entry_fs.cpp fail SOONER -- (ii)
//     alone takes t* = 6.16 down to 3.39, (i) with it to 2.54, both with the
//     recipient fix to 2.23 -- against a baseline trajectory that is physically
//     sensible out to t* = 5.4, the body decelerating through impact and
//     settling to y_c/L = -1.12. The demonstrator's reach depends on these two
//     errors cancelling something else, and shipping either one alone trades a
//     correct ledger for a demonstrator that dies during the impact it exists
//     to show. Whatever they are cancelling has not been found. Do not "fix"
//     (i) or (ii) without re-running that case; the books getting better while
//     the physics gets worse is the signature to expect.
//
//     Bounce-back, momentum exchange and refill are all in place and are not
//     the problem.

  // have to be constructed. The cheap choice is equilibrium alone, which is what
  // settle() uses for a gas cell arriving from nothing; it is wrong here,
  // because it discards the local viscous stress and the very next momentum
  // exchange on this cell's links reports that stress as a force. Copying the
  // non-equilibrium part from ONE fluid neighbour keeps it, needs no collinear
  // stencil -- so it does not fail in a narrow gap or against a thin body, where
  // a three-point normal extrapolation has nowhere to stand -- and cannot
  // overshoot, because it adds a valid non-equilibrium to a valid equilibrium.
  //
  // The donor is the fluid neighbour most nearly along the outward normal, which
  // here is approximated by the direction away from the body centre. seed_value
  // rather than Equilibrium::eq, so the refill agrees with whatever operator is
