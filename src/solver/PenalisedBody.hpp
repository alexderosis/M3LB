//  A rigid body in the flow, by volume penalisation (direct forcing).
//
//  WHY NOT AN IMMERSED BOUNDARY, and why not moving bounce-back.
//
//  De Rosis & Enan drive their wedge with a Peskin-style immersed boundary:
//  Lagrangian markers on the surface, interpolation and spreading kernels, a
//  body force fed into F_b. That is the standard tool and it is more accurate at
//  the surface than this. It is also a great deal more machinery, and for a body
//  whose INTERIOR must move rigidly -- a solid square, not a thin shell -- a
//  volumetric penalisation enforces the same condition with a fraction of it.
//
//  Moving BOUNCE-BACK geometry would be the other route and is worse here. It
//  needs the solid mask rebuilt on the host every time the body advances, which
//  is a full pass over the domain plus rebuild_lists(); it needs a refill scheme
//  for nodes the body uncovers, whose populations are meaningless; and it
//  quantises the body's position to whole cells, so a smoothly falling square
//  arrives in lattice-sized jumps and each one radiates a pressure pulse.
//  Penalisation has none of those problems: nothing about the geometry is ever
//  rebuilt, the body's position and ANGLE are continuous, and there are no fresh
//  nodes. Rotation in particular is nearly free here and would be a rewrite in
//  either of the other two.
//
//  THE METHOD. A smooth solid indicator chi in [0, 1] and a force that drives
//  the fluid there toward the body's rigid velocity field,
//
//      F(x) = chi(x) * 2 rho(x) [ U + omega x r - u*(x) ],   r = x - x_c,
//
//  which is direct forcing: applied through the same half-force machinery the
//  rest of the code uses, one step of it takes u to the rigid field exactly
//  where chi = 1. It must run AFTER compute_macroscopic() and BEFORE the fluid
//  steps.
//
//  TWO DENSITIES, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME ONE. refresh() takes an optional
//  second functor, and a free surface is why.
//
//    THE LIQUID DENSITY scales the force and everything Newton needs: the
//      fictitious mass, its moments, the momentum deficit. A cell a tenth full
//      of liquid holds a tenth of the fluid and must be pushed a tenth as hard,
//      or a body would feel a full cell's resistance from a nearly empty one --
//      and would displace a full cell's worth of buoyancy from it.
//    THE LBM DENSITY is what the fluid solver divides the force BY. The stored
//      velocity is u = sum_i c_i f_i / rho + F/(2 rho) with rho the zeroth
//      moment, whatever the cell's fill level, so undoing this body's previous
//      contribution to u must divide by that same rho and nothing else.
//
//  With a phase field the two are identical and the second functor is omitted.
//  With the free surface of FreeSurfaceSolver.hpp they differ across the whole
//  interface shell, and conflating them is a 1/epsilon amplification on exactly
//  the cells a body enters the water through. Measured: a square in free fall
//  reached the surface at the right speed and then diverged within a step of
//  touching it, taking the rotation solve with it -- 285000 degrees of tilt.
//
//  A CELL WITH NO FLUID IN IT IS NOT FORCED, and the reciprocal is guarded for
//  it. With a phase field the local density never approaches zero --
//  the light phase is still a fluid -- and the guard never fires. With the free
//  surface of FreeSurfaceSolver.hpp it fires constantly: above the waterline
//  there are no populations at all, so the force written there is never
//  integrated by anything, and subtracting it from u* on the next step is
//  subtracting something that did not happen. Dividing by a near-zero density
//  turns that into a large number: measured with a floor of 1e-3 under the
//  density, the correction was amplified five hundredfold and settled into a
//  fixed point where the reaction exactly cancelled gravity -- a body in free
//  fall that hovered, with nothing in the output to say why. With the guard, an
//  empty cell contributes no force, no fictitious mass and no momentum deficit,
//  which is what "there is no fluid here" should mean.
//
//  u* IS NOT THE STORED VELOCITY, and this is the one thing that has to be right.
//  The solver defines u = sum_i c_i f_i + F/(2 rho) with F the TOTAL force, so
//  the velocity field already contains this body's force from the previous step.
//  Feeding that back in applies the correction twice: the body over-shoots, the
//  fluid over-shoots back, and the pair diverges within a few hundred steps --
//  measured, the square left the domain at six million times the impact speed.
//
//  So the previous contribution is removed first,
//
//      u* = u_stored - F_prev / (2 rho),
//
//  which leaves the velocity the fluid would have had from every OTHER force,
//  and that is what direct forcing is defined against. The arrays hold F_prev
//  already, so this costs one subtraction and no extra state.
//
//  chi IS SMOOTHED over about a cell and a half rather than being a sharp mask.
//  A sharp one is a staircase again -- the body's surface would sit on lattice
//  planes and its effective shape would change as it fell, or as it TURNED. The
//  smoothing is what lets the square occupy a continuously varying pose.
//
//  THE REACTION IS FREE, and that is the point of doing it this way: the force
//  the body exerts on the fluid is known at every node, so the force and torque
//  the fluid exerts on the body are minus its sum and minus the sum of r x F.
//  That closes Newton's equations and lets the body FALL, FLOAT and ROLL under
//  gravity and buoyancy rather than being pushed at a prescribed speed.
//==============================================================================
//
//  NEWTON, AND WHY THE OBVIOUS ARRANGEMENT OF IT CANNOT FLOAT.
//
//  The penalised region is not empty: it is full of fluid that the forcing drags
//  along, and that fluid's inertia and weight are both already inside the
//  reaction. Using the body's own mass alone would count them twice. Writing m_f
//  for that fictitious fluid mass, the exact bookkeeping is
//
//      m_b dU/dt = R + dP_in/dt + (m_b - m_f) g,
//
//  and Uhlmann's classical step approximates dP_in/dt as m_f dU/dt, moves it
//  across, and divides:
//
//      dU = [ R + (m_b - m_f) g ] / (m_b - m_f).
//
//  That denominator is the whole problem. It vanishes for a neutrally buoyant
//  body and changes sign for a light one, so a floating body -- the only
//  interesting kind, since floating is what a density ratio is FOR -- is
//  precisely the case the arrangement cannot express. The previous version of
//  this file said so and refused to try.
//
//  The fix is not a different model. It is the observation that the reaction is
//  LINEAR in the body velocity that produces it,
//
//      R = -sum chi 2 rho (U + omega x r - u*),
//
//  so if the force written into the arrays targets the velocity the body is
//  ABOUT to have rather than the one it already has, R moves to the left-hand
//  side and the same equation comes out with a different denominator:
//
//      (m_b + m_f) dU = 2 dP + (m_b - m_f) g,
//
//  where dP = sum chi rho (u* - u_rigid) is the inner fluid's momentum deficit
//  relative to rigid motion -- the hydrodynamic signal, and the only place the
//  fluid enters. Algebraically this is Uhlmann's equation multiplied through; the
//  difference is entirely that the body and the fluid are now solved at the SAME
//  instant instead of the fluid lagging the body by a step. The denominator
//  m_b + m_f is positive for every mass, the homogeneous factor is
//  (m_b - m_f)/(m_b + m_f) whose modulus is below one for every mass, and the
//  neutrally buoyant case -- previously a division by zero -- is now the
//  best-conditioned point on the line. Nothing is tuned and no limit is imposed.
//
//  WITH ROTATION the same substitution gives a 3x3 system rather than a scalar,
//  and it does not decouple: the first moments S = sum chi rho r of the
//  fictitious mass about the body centre are non-zero the moment the body
//  straddles an interface, because half of it is standing in water and half in
//  air. Those moments couple sway to roll,
//
//      [ A    0   -S_y ] [dU_x]   [ 2 dP_x + (m_b - m_f) g_x ]
//      [ 0    A    S_x ] [dU_y] = [ 2 dP_y + (m_b - m_f) g_y ],
//      [-S_y  S_x   B  ] [dw  ]   [ 2 dL   - (S_x g_y - S_y g_x) ]
//
//  with A = m_b + m_f and B = I_b + I_f. The matrix is symmetric, and it is
//  positive definite for every body: Cauchy-Schwarz on the measure chi rho gives
//  |S|^2 <= m_f I_f <= A B, so the Schur complement B - |S|^2/A is positive
//  whenever the body has mass and inertia of its own. It is solved in closed
//  form, on the host, once a step -- three lines.
//
//  THE LAST TERM IN THE THIRD ROW IS THE RIGHTING MOMENT, and it is the reason a
//  raft comes back upright. The body's own weight acts at its centre and exerts
//  no torque about it; the displaced fluid's weight does not, because the
//  displaced fluid is heavier on the submerged side, and -(S x g) is exactly the
//  hydrostatic couple that metacentric theory calls rho g V GM sin(theta). It is
//  not put in by hand for that purpose -- it falls out of the same subtraction
//  that produced (m_b - m_f) g in the rows above. See validation/floating_body.
//
//  ONE REDUCTION, NOT TWO. All seven integrals come from a single sweep, the
//  3x3 is solved from them, and the force is then written in a plain
//  parallel_for -- there is no second reduction, because R and the torque follow
//  in closed form from the solve:
//
//      R = 2 dP - 2 [ m_f dU + dw (z x S) ],   T = 2 dL - 2 [ I_f dw + S x dU ].
//
//  So the reported reaction is a derived diagnostic, exact to round-off against
//  -sum F but not an independent measurement of it. The physics enters through
//  dP and dL, which are measured.
//
//  WHAT THIS DOES NOT MODEL.
//
//   * NO CONTACT LINE. The phase field is advected by the fluid velocity and
//     knows nothing about the body, so nothing sets the angle at which the free
//     surface meets the solid. Inside the body u is driven to the rigid field, so
//     the interface is carried with it rather than through it, and the
//     conservative Allen-Cahn form keeps the profile from simply diffusing in --
//     but the wetting physics is absent, and water entry is a contact-line
//     problem. Read the splash, not the meniscus. For a FLOATING body the same
//     gap means there is no surface-tension contribution to the draft: a body
//     small enough for that to matter (Bond number of order one) is out of scope.
//   * NO SUB-CELL SURFACE. Penalisation resolves the body to the smoothing
//     width, so a pressure read at the face of the square is a smoothed pressure
//     over a cell or two. Integrated force is far more trustworthy than local
//     pressure, which is the usual situation with this family of methods. The
//     same applies to the draft, which is resolved to the interface width.
//   * NO COLLISION MODEL. Two bodies, or a body meeting a wall, will simply
//     interpenetrate: nothing here computes a contact force. The single body's
//     floor stop in the water-entry demonstrator is a clamp in the driver, not
//     physics.
//   * TWO DIMENSIONS. The rigid-body solve carries one angle and one angular
//     velocity about z. In 3D it would be a 6x6 with a rotating inertia tensor
//     and a quaternion, which is a different piece of work; the fluid side would
//     not change at all.
//   * UNIFORM DENSITY ONLY. The body's centre of mass is taken to be the
//     centre of the rectangle, which is what lets its own weight drop out of
//     the roll equation. Ballast low in the hull is the standard way to make a
//     tall body float upright, and it is exactly what this cannot express: it
//     would need a second centre, a BG that no longer follows from the draft,
//     and a weight torque restored to the third row.
//   * FIVE SHAPES, NOT ONE. This said "no shape but a rectangle" long after
//     Wedge, Sphere, Box and Disc were added beside Rect; it was simply stale.
//     Anything with a signed distance function still drops straight in.
//   * EVERY INDICATOR MARKS THE BODY, NOT THE CONTAINER. chi is 1 INSIDE the
//     shape, so a fluid-filled vessel -- a circular tank, a pipe -- is the
//     complement of one of these and is not expressible here. A case that wants
//     one writes its own chi and feeds it through FieldGuo, which is what
//     validation/stokes_disc.cpp does.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A symmetric wedge, for De Rosis & Enan's Sec. III.G water entry: an apex
// pointing DOWN and two faces rising from it at the deadrise angle phi, capped
// at the knuckle. Same idiom as Rect below -- a plain struct, tilt carried as
// its cosine and sine, a product of tanh indicators -- so everything the body
// does with a Rect it does with this unchanged.
//
// THE ORIGIN IS THE APEX, NOT THE CENTROID, and that is a deliberate difference
// from Rect. A water-entry case prescribes the depth of the apex and compares
// against a wetted length measured from it, so carrying the apex is what the
// driver actually wants; putting the centroid there would mean converting on
// every read. The consequence is that `free_rotation` about this origin is NOT
// the physical roll axis -- the case this shape exists for drives both degrees
// of freedom, and a freely rotating wedge would need the centroid offset
// (0, 2 height / 3) folded in first.
//
// GEOMETRY. In the body frame with the apex at the origin, the wedge is the set
//
//     Y > |X| tan(phi)      above the two faces
//     Y < H                 below the knuckle,  H = half_beam tan(phi)
//
// and the face condition is written as a true normal distance,
//
//     d_face = Y cos(phi) - |X| sin(phi),
//
// because cos^2 + sin^2 = 1 makes that the perpendicular distance to whichever
// face the point is on. Scaling `smooth` against a non-normalised distance
// would make the smoothing width depend on the deadrise angle, so that a
// shallow wedge got a diffuse surface and a steep one a sharp surface -- the
// kind of thing that quietly turns a deadrise sweep into a smoothing sweep.
//
// THE APEX IS ROUNDED, AND IT MATTERS MOST WHERE THE PHYSICS DOES. The product
// of two tanh indicators rounds a convex corner, exactly as Rect's does, and a
// wedge apex is a sharper corner than a rectangle's right angle. Measured as
// the integral of chi over the nominal area b^2 tan(phi):
//
//     deadrise     b = 100, smooth = 1     b = 30, smooth = 1
//     10 deg           +0.50 %                 +5.6 %
//     15 deg           +0.23 %                 +2.6 %
//     30 deg           +0.06 %                 +0.64 %
//     45 deg           +0.03 %                 +0.28 %
//
// So the penalised wedge is slightly LARGER than the nominal one, the excess
// concentrated at the apex, and it grows as the wedge sharpens or the body
// shrinks against the smoothing width. For water entry that is the worst place
// for it: the apex is where the impact starts and where Wagner's wetted length
// is measured from, so a shallow-deadrise run wants a big body in cells rather
// than a small one with the smoothing turned down -- reducing `smooth` below
// about one cell makes the indicator a step again and reintroduces the
// lattice-quantised pressure pulses penalisation exists to avoid.

// A DISC -- a flat circular cylinder, for a skipping stone.
//
// THE SYMMETRY AXIS IS BODY y, NOT BODY z, and that is a deliberate choice of
// reference rather than a convention inherited from anywhere. Gravity here is
// -y, so at the identity orientation this disc lies FLAT with its axis
// vertical: the pose a stone is in just before it is thrown. Every angle a
// caller then sets is a departure from that, which is what makes an attack
// angle readable in the driver instead of being a quaternion nobody can check
// by eye. With the axis on body z the identity pose would be a disc standing on
// its edge, and every case would open by rotating 90 degrees for no reason.
//
// chi is a PRODUCT of a radial and an axial profile, so the rim and the two
// faces are each smoothed over `smooth` cells and the edge where they meet is
// rounded. That is the same construction as Box's three tanhs and has the same
// consequence: the penalised disc is slightly larger than the nominal one, so
// the volume and the inertia are MEASURED (set_uniform_density6) rather than
// taken from pi R^2 (2 hy).
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. A real skipping stone is lenticular -- thicker at the centre,
// tapering to a sharp rim -- and this is a flat cylinder with a rounded edge.
// The lift in a skip comes from the pressure on the WETTED AREA at an angle of
// attack, which a flat underside reproduces; the rim profile matters for how
// the flow leaves, and there is no contact-line model here anyway, so the
// tapered rim would be modelling something the scheme cannot carry.
