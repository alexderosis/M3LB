//  Magnetic field solver: a VECTOR-valued distribution set.
//
//  Where the thermal module added one extra distribution, this adds D of them --
//  one per component of B, on their own lattice, streamed independently but
//  collided together, because the induction equilibrium mixes components through
//  u_beta B_alpha - B_beta u_alpha.
//
//  Each component gets its own Streaming instance, so Esoteric Pull, the halo
//  logic and the neighbour machinery are reused verbatim; only the collision is
//  new. The fluid runs on D2Q9/D3Q19/D3Q27 while this runs on D2Q5/D3Q7 at the
//  same time, on the same Domain.
//
//  BOUNDARY CONDITIONS. Two kinds, both moment based:
//    * Dirichlet -- the node takes an imposed external field (Dellar, 13a-13b);
//    * outflow   -- the node takes B from its upstream neighbour, zero gradient.
//  Conducting and insulating magnetic walls are a separate piece of work and are
//  not faked here.

// Per-node magnetic boundary kind.
//
// MagOutXp IS NOT VALIDATED and has a measured defect. On the inlet-driven
// Hartmann flow of validation/hartmann_inlet.cpp -- whose exact solution is
// independent of x, so any streamwise variation is boundary error -- it drives
// B about 6% high over the last ~10 nodes, and the overshoot decays upstream
// only slowly. Moving the outlet from Lx = 121 to Lx = 241 cut the sampled
// error by 3.4x. The condition is kept because with the outlet far enough from
// anything being measured the interior converges cleanly at second order, but
// it should be fixed before being relied on. The cause is not identified; the
// natural suspects are the interaction with div(B) = 0 (see the known
// limitation on divergence preservation) and the fact that a pure Neumann
// condition does not constrain the field level at all.
// MagNeumann is the PERFECTLY CONDUCTING wall: dB/dn = 0. It is mechanically
// the same as MagOutXp -- the node takes its field from a neighbour one step
// inward and then imposes that as its moment -- except that the direction comes
// from the wall's own outward normal instead of being hard-coded to -x, which
// is what lets it sit on any face of a duct rather than only on an outlet.
//
// The physics it encodes: at an insulating wall the induced field has nowhere
// to go and vanishes, which is Dirichlet on the total field; at a perfectly
// conducting wall the tangential electric field vanishes instead, and in the
// induced-field formulation that is a zero NORMAL DERIVATIVE. The two give
// measurably different flows -- Shercliff's duct against Hunt's -- so this is
// not a refinement of MagDirichlet but its counterpart.
//
// IT NEEDS A DIRICHLET BOUNDARY SOMEWHERE ON THE DOMAIN, and that is a real
// restriction rather than a caution. Measured 2026-09-14 in
// demonstrator/mhd_decay.cpp: a CLOSED boundary that is Neumann on every face
// goes non-finite inside sixty steps, at the grid scale -- the magnetic energy
// rises 263x in twenty steps, max|b| goes 0.14 -> 19.2, and the magnetic
// integral scale collapses to one cell. It is not the staircase (a square
// domain, with 0.9 % of its Neumann nodes reading another wall node against a
// disc's 14.6 %, fails identically) and it is not omega -> 2 (1.949, 1.901,
// 1.769 and 1.586 all fail identically). The control that holds is Hunt's own
// arrangement: Neumann on ONE opposing pair of faces with Dirichlet on the
// other decays cleanly. So use MagNeumann for a conducting wall PAIR inside a
// domain whose remaining boundary is Dirichlet, which is what Hunt's duct is
// and what validation/shercliff.cpp validated; do not close a domain with it.
// A pure Neumann problem does not determine the field level, and the |<b>|
// drift is visible even in the arrangements that work -- mhd_decay's Hunt
// control has the domain mean climb two decades while max|b| falls one.

  // A PER-NODE SOURCE ON THE INDUCTION EQUATION, off unless set.

  // This exists for volume penalisation -- Neffaa, Bos & Schneider impose their
  // magnetic boundary that way rather than with a wall condition -- but it is
  // deliberately a general SOURCE rather than a penalisation, because their
  // condition is not the one a "penalise B toward zero" hook can express.
  //
  // THE CONDITION IS B.n = 0, NOT B = 0. Their solid is "a perfect conductor,
  // coated inside with a thin layer of insulant", so the field may not PENETRATE
  // it but the tangential component is free: their Eq. (2) penalises toward
  // B_0 = B_parallel, i.e. the source is -chi (B.n) n / eps and it damps the
  // normal component only. Writing it as -chi B / eps instead would impose
  // B = 0, which is the INSULATING wall -- a different physical problem, and
  // one this file's -walls insul already provides sharply. Keeping the source
  // general lets the case say which it wants rather than having the solver
  // assume.
  //
  // WHY IT IS DISTRIBUTED ON THE WEIGHTS. The source has to change the zeroth
  // moment, which is B, and nothing else -- the first moment is the induction
  // flux u B - B u and a penalisation has no business touching it. Adding
  // w_i S_a to every population does exactly that: sum_i w_i = 1 puts S_a into
  // B, and sum_i w_i c_i = 0 leaves the flux untouched. Any other distribution
  // would penalise the flux as well and would not be the stated equation.
