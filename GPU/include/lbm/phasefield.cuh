//  Phase-field two-phase flow at a density ratio, on the GPU.
//
//  De Rosis & Enan, Phys. Fluids 33, 043315 (2021). Equation numbers are that
//  paper's. A port of ../src/collision/PhaseFieldBGK.hpp,
//  ../src/collision/MultiphasePotentialBGK.hpp, ../src/solver/
//  PhaseFieldSolver.hpp and ../src/solver/ViscousInterfaceForce.hpp.
//
//  THE SECOND MULTIPHASE ENGINE HERE, and a genuinely different one from
//  colour.cuh. There the interface is wherever both colours are non-zero and
//  segregation is algebraic; here the interface is a FIELD with its own
//  advection equation, its own distribution set and a prescribed width W. The
//  colour gradient reaches a density ratio through the rest weight; this one
//  reaches it by moving the density out of the distribution entirely.
//
//  THREE DISTRIBUTIONS' WORTH OF WORK, ON TWO LATTICES:
//
//    f_i on D3Q27   the fluid, carrying a normalised PRESSURE
//    h_i on PL      the phase field, carrying phi in [0, 1]; PL is D3Q7 by
//                   default and D3Q27 when the central-moment operator is
//                   wanted, since that needs a product velocity set
//    grad phi and lap phi on D3Q27, by stencil from the phi FIELD
//
//  TWO OPERATORS FOR EACH DISTRIBUTION, chosen independently: PhaseOp and
//  MultiOp. BOTH default to CENTRAL MOMENTS where the lattice can carry them --
//  the fluid always, since it is always D3Q27; the phase field only on D3Q27,
//  falling back to BGK on the D3Q7 default lattice, which has no product basis.
//  See the block above PhaseModel.
//
//  WHY THE ZEROTH MOMENT CARRIES PRESSURE. At a density ratio rho is no longer
//  a small perturbation about 1 and a density-carrying distribution stops being
//  well conditioned. The incompressible model moves rho out of the distribution:
//  rho is a function of phi (Eq. 25, linear interpolation) and the populations
//  carry
//
//      p~ = sum_i f_i,      u = sum_i c_i f_i + F/(2 rho),             (24)
//
//  with the equilibrium of Eq. (10), f_i^eq = w_i [p~ + Phi_i(u)], whose zeroth
//  moment is p~ exactly and whose FIRST MOMENT IS u, NOT rho u. There is no
//  division by rho in the momentum sum; only the half-force correction carries
//  one. Getting that wrong is a viscosity error that reads like a bad boundary.
//
//  THE COUPLING ORDER IS INSIDE THIS CLASS ON PURPOSE. The parent documents it
//  as the thing a driver gets wrong, so here step() owns it rather than a
//  caller:
//
//      1  phi from h                     (read-only, so any parity)
//      2  grad phi and lap phi from phi  (needs 1 complete at the NEIGHBOURS)
//      3  the viscous interface force    (needs u(t-1) and grad phi(t))
//      4  grad p~                        (constant-reference form only)
//      5  the fluid step                 (collides against grad phi(t), writes u(t))
//      6  the phase step                 (advects h with u(t))
//
//  Refreshing phi AFTER the fluid would be a first-order splitting error that
//  does NOT refine away, and it is worse in kind than the usual one: the
//  interface MOVES, so the error is a systematically misplaced interface rather
//  than a damping offset. Six kernel launches on one stream give six fences and
//  there is no cudaDeviceSynchronize on the step path.
//
//  ONE GATHER SERVES BOTH DERIVATIVES. The Laplacian needs exactly the
//  neighbours the gradient has already loaded, so it is one more accumulator in
//  the same kernel. Eqs. (20)-(21):
//
//      grad phi = (1/cs2) sum_i w_i c_i phi(x + c_i)
//      lap  phi = (2/cs2) sum_i w_i     [phi(x + c_i) - phi(x)]
//
//  taken on D3Q27 rather than the phase field's own D3Q7. That is deliberate:
//  spurious currents around a static droplet are dominated by the isotropy of
//  this stencil and the axis-only one is markedly worse.
//
//  THE ANTI-DIFFUSION SOURCE, AND WHY ITS PREFACTOR IS NOT GUO'S. With
//  sum_i S_i = 0 and sum_i c_i S_i = A_S, Chapman-Enskog gives
//  d_t phi + div(phi u) = M lap phi - (1/omega) div A_S, so A_S = omega M theta n
//  and, using omega M = cs2(1 - omega/2), the source is simply
//
//      S_i = (1 - omega/2) theta w_i (c_i . n),      theta = (4/W) phi (1 - phi)
//
//  carrying no mobility and no cs2 at all. The coefficient is 1/omega, NOT the
//  1/(1 - omega/2) a Guo force compensates: a body force enters the FIRST-moment
//  equation, where the half step is absorbed into the velocity, while this
//  enters the ZEROTH-moment equation through the divergence of the first, so it
//  contributes twice. Getting it wrong is silent in its cause -- the interface
//  simply spreads as though the term were absent.
//
//  TWO PRESSURE NORMALISATIONS, AND NEITHER DOMINATES.
//
//    rho_0 <= 0 (default)  p = rho(phi) cs2 p~,  F_p = -p~ cs2 grad rho
//    rho_0 >  0            p = rho_0    cs2 p~,  F_p =  cs2 (rho - rho_0) grad p~
//
//  The first is the paper's. Because p is continuous while rho is not, p~ jumps
//  by the whole density ratio across an interface, so F_p scales with the
//  pressure LEVEL and is amplified by the ratio. The parent measures the cost on
//  a layered Poiseuille flow: the residual does not converge (order -0.21) and a
//  pure gauge shift in p~, which changes no physics, moves the error
//  seventeenfold. The second normalises by a constant, so F_p scales with the
//  pressure GRADIENT: order 0.95 and a gauge sensitivity of 1.9x on the same
//  case. It is not a free win -- the recovered pressure term becomes
//  -(rho_0/rho) cs2 grad p~, so one phase always pays, and rho_0 MUST be the
//  light phase or the heavy one runs past the lattice speed. Local-rho stays the
//  default because that is what every validated result was obtained with.
//
//  WHAT IS NOT HERE, and absent rather than untested:
//
//   * WETTING. A phase wall is zero-flux on the populations, which is right for
//     the transport, but sets no contact angle: that needs a condition on
//     grad phi at the wall. Do not put an interface against a wall.
//   * OPEN BOUNDARIES for phi.
//   * ANY NON-PRODUCT LATTICE, on either distribution: the factorised
//     transform does not apply to one at all. The paper's own scheme is D3Q19
//     and gets there by writing out a 19x19, which is a different piece of work
//     and is not done here or in the parent.
//
//  MEMORY. f at 27 Real, h at 7 (D3Q7) or 27 (D3Q27), plus phi, grad phi (3),
//  lap, u (3) and, when used, the viscous force (3) and grad p~ (3). At FP32
//  that is 108 + 28 + 32 = 168 bytes per node with the D3Q7 phase field, 192
//  with both optional fields, and 248 with the D3Q27 phase field -- so the
//  product lattice costs about 1.5x the footprint and, being bandwidth bound,
//  close to that in time. That is the price of the central-moment operator and
//  it is paid at allocation, not at the switch.
//
//  MEASURED ON A T4, FP32, 64^3: 354.6 MLUPS, against the colour gradient's
//  252.5 and the single-phase core's 950 -- six passes and two distributions for
//  37% of a single-phase step. -DLBM_PTXAS_VERBOSE=ON reports 0 bytes of stack
//  frame and no spills on every kernel here (43, 64 and 72 registers for the
//  phase, fluid and derivative passes). That is colour.cuh's lesson applied by
//  construction: nothing above is materialised as an array beyond the one f[27]
//  the collision needs.
//
//  ONE PARAMETER TRAP, MEASURED. A static droplet at a density ratio of 100
//  DIVERGES with the dynamic viscosity matched across the phases, and that is
//  arithmetic rather than the model: matched mu leaves the heavy phase with a
//  hundred-fold smaller kinematic viscosity, so
//  omega = 1/(mu/(rho cs2) + 1/2) = 1.994 against a limit of 2. Matching the
//  KINEMATIC viscosity instead runs the same case to -3.75% of the asked surface
//  tension with a spurious current twenty times smaller. When one of these
//  diverges at a ratio, omega is the first thing to print.

// THE PHASE LATTICE IS A TEMPLATE PARAMETER, D3Q7 BY DEFAULT.

// D3Q7 is enough for BGK: the phase field carries only its zeroth moment and a
// first-order equilibrium, so the fourth-order isotropy D3Q27 provides is never
// used, and seven populations against twenty-seven is a 3.9x saving in the
// traffic that dominates the kernel.
//
// It is NOT enough for central moments. The transform in core.cuh is three
// one-dimensional passes over the triple at c = -1, 0, +1 on each axis, which
// needs the velocity set to be a tensor product; D3Q7 is a star, not a cube. So
// PhaseFieldSolver<D3Q7> runs BGK only, PhaseFieldSolver<D3Q27> runs either, and
// the cost of the choice is exact and worth stating: the phase populations go
// from 7 to 27 per node, so a multiphase step's population traffic rises from 34
// slots to 54 -- about 1.6x. That is what a central-moment phase field costs on a

//
//  BOTH USE core.cuh's to_moments/to_populations UNCHANGED, and that is the
//  whole reason these are short. That transform is the SHIFTED product basis --
//  phi_2(C) = C^2 - cs^2, three one-dimensional passes -- which is exactly
//  ProductBasis in the parent. Everything below is a statement about which
//  slots get what; none of it is a new transform.
//
//  A PUBLISHED MOMENT LIST BELONGS TO A BASIS, and this is where that bites.
//  The paper tabulates its equilibrium and source central moments in the
//  MONOMIAL basis. In the shifted one they are far sparser, because the two
//  bases put the same physics in different slots:
//
//    * equilibrium, phase field: the paper's five nonzero entries (k0 = phi,
//      k4 = phi, k16 = k17 = k18 = phi cs^4) collapse to ONE, k^eq = (phi, 0,
//      ..., 0), since k4' = k4 - 3 cs2 k0 = 0 and likewise for the rest.
//    * source, phase field: their Eq. (61) lists nine nonzero entries -- three
//      at first order and six at third. The six are identically zero here: the
//      (a,a,b) slot is (C_a^2 - cs2) C_b and the same source contributes
//      cs4 A_b - cs2 cs2 A_b = 0. Adding them would DOUBLE COUNT; deleting
//      them from a monomial implementation would LOSE them. Neither crashes.
//
//  AND THE SPARSITY IS A REST-FRAME PROPERTY. Transform the source at a general
//  u and 26 of the 27 shifted moments are nonzero, not 3. Their drivers add a
//  u-independent source and so does this: a shared approximation, not an
//  identity. The parent measures the difference on an advected flat slab at
//  50 000 steps -- 1.3% and 0.3% of the width drift -- so it is not what limits
//  the operator, but it is an approximation and is named as one.
