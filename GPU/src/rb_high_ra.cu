//==============================================================================
//  Rayleigh-Benard at high Rayleigh number -- the free-fall parameterisation.
//
//  A port of a D3Q19 reference driver onto this code's D3Q27 fluid and D3Q7
//  scalar. Layer of depth H, heated from below, periodic in x, isothermal
//  no-slip plates, Boussinesq buoyancy, central moments on both distributions
//  in the reference and on the fluid here.
//
//  ================= WHY THIS IS NOT rayleigh_benard.cu ======================
//  That driver fixes nu and DERIVES g from Ra. It is the right way round for
//  the onset problem it solves -- bracketing Ra_c = 1707.762 -- and it is the
//  wrong way round above Ra ~ 1e6, because the free-fall velocity it implies,
//
//      U_f = sqrt(g beta dT H) = (nu / H) sqrt(Ra / Pr),
//
//  then grows without bound. At Ra = 1e14 with the default nu = 0.02 it is 1.5
//  at H = 4337 and 24.7 at H = 256: supersonic, and the run is nonsense while
//  still printing numbers. Keeping U_f <= 0.05 that way would need H >= 126491.
//
//  So this driver inverts it, exactly as the reference does. U_f is the INPUT
//  and the transport coefficients follow:
//
//      g beta = U_f^2 / (dT H),     nu = U_f H sqrt(Pr / Ra),     alpha = nu/Pr.
//
//  Three choices -- H, Ra, U_f -- and tau is not a fourth. Read it back before
//  running: at the reference point it is 0.5000001264.
//  ===========================================================================
//
//  cs2 IS 1/4 ON D3Q7, AND THAT IS THE ONE LINE THAT DOES NOT TRANSCRIBE.
//  The reference carries its temperature on D3Q19 and so writes
//  tauT = 3 alpha + 1/2. Here the scalar is D3Q7. Copying that line would give
//  alpha' = 3 alpha / 4 -- a Prandtl number 4/3 too large, converged, stable,
//  and wrong. `Scalar` takes the diffusivity and reads its own lattice's cs2,
//  which is why the constructor is handed alpha and not a relaxation rate.
//
//  BUILD THIS IN FP64 -- but the reason is H-dependent, so it is printed rather
//  than asserted. nu = U H sqrt(Pr/Ra), so tau - 1/2 grows LINEARLY with H while
//  the FP32 spacing at 0.5 stays at 2^-24 = 5.96e-08. At the reference point
//  (H = 50) the excess viscosity is 1.264e-07, TWO ulp: nu is quantised by ~24%
//  and Ra with it, and FP32 is simply solving a different problem. By H = 1000
//  it is 2.53e-06, forty-two ulp, and the quantisation is ~1.2% -- immaterial
//  next to a run this under-resolved. The startup line prints the ulp count and
//  says which case it is; do not carry the H = 50 answer to another H.
//
//  MEASURED COST, T4, FP64, central moments (2026-09-04). H = 50 is 5200 cells
//  and launch-latency-bound: 134 MLUPS, 38.7 us/step. H = 1000 is 2.0M cells and
//  runs at ~17 ms/step, i.e. ~120 MLUPS -- NOT bandwidth-bound (that would be
//  ~300), because a consumer card's FP64 ALU rate is 1/32 of its FP32 one and
//  the central-moment collision is arithmetic-heavy. One free-fall time at
//  H = 1000 is 100000 steps, so about 28 minutes.
//  This is not a stability question, it is a question of which Ra is being
//  solved. Configure with -DLBM_DOUBLE=ON. The cost is ~2x here (the kernels
//  are bandwidth-bound, not FP64-throughput-bound) and at these grid sizes the
//  run is launch-latency-bound anyway.
//
//  nz = 1, AND ESOTERIC PULL SURVIVES IT. In a periodic direction one cell
//  deep, wrap(z +/- 1, 1) = z, so a +/-z pair's neighbour IS the node. The
//  in-place scheme still writes slots i and i+1 -- two distinct slots at one
//  node -- so there is no collision and the population simply stays put, which
//  is what streaming into yourself means. That makes the run genuinely 2-D
//  rather than quasi-2-D, and 4x cheaper than the nz = 4 slab in the sibling
//  driver. `-nz 4` is kept so the two can be compared; they agree.
//
//  WALL FAMILY, AND THE HALF CELL. The reference puts BOTH walls ON the node
//  (regularised velocity, regularised temperature) so its layer is ny - 1 deep.
//  This driver uses the halfway pair instead -- bounce-back for the momentum,
//  anti-bounce-back for the scalar -- so both planes sit at y = 0.5 and
//  y = H + 0.5 and the layer is exactly H deep with ny = H + 2. That pairing is
//  the one whose Ra_c this code reproduces, which is the evidence that H means
//  what Ra says it means. The cost of the difference is half a cell in H: 1% in
//  H, 3% in Ra, 0.9% in Nu -- far below this run's discretisation error, see
//  below. An on-node scalar Dirichlet does not exist here yet; adding one is
//  the way to match the reference's family exactly, not a flag on this file.
//
//  ========================= WHAT Nu MEANS HERE ==============================
//  READ THIS BEFORE QUOTING A NUMBER. The 2-D correlation Nu ~ 0.14 Ra^0.29
//  gives Nu ~ 1600 at Ra = 1e14, hence a thermal boundary layer
//  delta = H / 2Nu of 0.016 CELLS at H = 50. Nothing about the boundary layer
//  is resolved; a resolved 2-D DNS at this Ra wants H ~ 25000. Whatever Nu this
//  prints is a property of the discretisation -- an implicit LES, with the
//  central-moment operator at omega -> 2 supplying the dissipation -- and not a
//  measurement of Ra = 1e14.
//
//  The driver prints the evidence rather than the claim. Three estimators:
//
//    Nu_vol  = 1 + H <v' T'> / (alpha dT), the volume average -- on the
//              FLUCTUATIONS, <v T> - <v><T>, which is what the code computes
//              and what the raw form above said until 2026-09-18;
//    Nu_bot  = H (T_hot - <T>_{y=1}) / (0.5 dT),   the plate gradient below;
//    Nu_top  = H (<T>_{y=H} - T_cold) / (0.5 dT),  and above.
//
//  At a resolved steady state all three agree. The size of their disagreement
//  is the honest error bar, and it is why `-h` is the first flag to sweep.
//
//  ============ AND AT THE REFERENCE POINT IT DOES NOT SURVIVE =============
//  H = 50, Ra = 1e14, FP64, central moments, T4: conduction runs cleanly for
//  ~500 free-fall times, then the run DIVERGES the moment buoyancy wins ---
//  Nu_vol 1.0383 -> 6.50 -> 504.5 -> nan over 100 free-fall times, with max|u|
//  climbing 2.8e-06 -> 5.8e-05 -> 1.0e-03. tau_f - 1/2 = 1.26e-07 leaves nothing
//  to damp the flow once it starts, and a Nu_vol of 504 is impossible anyway
//  against the H/2 = 25 ceiling above.
//
//  The STEP at which it blows up is deliberately not quoted as a measurement:
//  this tree has been burned by that before (the blow-up step moves by 2x with
//  the Kokkos backend alone). What is reproducible is the ORDER of events ---
//  clean conduction, then divergence at onset --- and that raising H is the
//  lever, because nu = U H sqrt(Pr/Ra) grows with H: H = 1000 gives
//  tau_f - 1/2 = 2.53e-06, twenty times further off the floor, and lifts the Nu
//  ceiling from 25 to 500 at the same time. Lowering Ra at fixed H does the same
//  thing to tau and does NOT help the resolution, which is why it is the worse
//  of the two knobs.
//  ===========================================================================
//
//  ONE MORE ARITHMETIC NOTE ON Nu. The reference sums v T over ALL nx*ny nodes
//  and divides by (nx - 1). The exact volume average times H/alpha divides by
//  nx*ny*nz/H, which is 103.02 for its 101 x 51 grid against the 100 it uses:
//  its Nu - 1 runs 3.0% high. `Nu_ref` below reproduces that normalisation
//  verbatim (with nz folded in, which its nz = 1 grid leaves implicit) so the
//  two codes can be compared directly; `Nu_vol` is the exact
//  one. Do not mix them in a table.
//  ===========================================================================
//
//  THE SCALAR OPERATOR IS NOT BGK, AND IT CANNOT BE. The reference relaxes only
//  the first-order thermal moments and puts every higher one at equilibrium.
//  BGK on D3Q7 instead relaxes the ghost moments at the same omega, and at
//  omega = 1.99999905 that is a reflection: with `-sop bgk` the near-wall
//  temperature RINGS rather than relaxing -- Nu_bot ran 100 -> 39.4 -> 78.7 over
//  ten free-fall times, bounded, so easy to average over and quote. `-sop reg`
//  is the default and is the D3Q7 form of the reference's operator; the flag is
//  kept because reproducing the ringing on demand is how it stays documented.
//
//  TWO SMALLER DEVIATIONS FROM THE REFERENCE, both deliberate.
//  1. Buoyancy uses rho0 = 1 rather than the local rho (core.cuh's
//     ForceBoussinesq). Under Boussinesq those differ by the density
//     perturbation, 1% at t = 0 and decaying -- and holding rho0 constant in
//     the buoyancy term is what Boussinesq means.
//  2. The seeded density mode is cos(2 pi x / nx), not the reference's
//     cos(2 pi x / (nx-1)), which has period nx-1 on an nx-periodic domain and
//     so does not close. The seed only has to pick a mode.
//
//  THE RESIDUAL IS MEASURED OVER THE OUTPUT INTERVAL, NOT PER STEP. A per-step
//  change is bounded by the timestep and shrinks as the grid refines whether or
//  not the flow has settled; the reference's 1e-12 per-step threshold cannot
//  fire on a turbulent field and would fire on a slow one. Over an interval it
//  is a statement about the field.
//
//  WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: no MPI, no grid stretching (so the boundary layer
//  costs the same as the bulk), no restart -- a run that outlives its session
//  is lost, which at these step counts is the binding constraint, not memory.
//
//    usage: rb_high_ra [-h H] [-aspect A] [-ra RA] [-pr PR] [-u U_REF]
//                      [-amp A] [-tf N] [-out N] [-op bgk|cm] [-sop reg|bgk]
//                      [-nz NZ] [-vtk] [-dump PREFIX] [-ic cond|cold]
//                      [-slack S] [-grace G]
//
//  -aspect is a DOUBLE (it was an int, which truncated 2.02 and 2.0158 to 2
//  in silence). -slack S sets the max-principle halt margin in units of dT,
//  default 0.5. -grace G suppresses the max-principle HALT (never the report)
//  for the first G free-fall times; the default is 0 for `cond` and a diffusive
//  estimate for `cold`, both printed at startup. `-grace 0` is the old rule.

//
//                       cold start     conductive
//     Ra = 1e14           -0.8133       -0.4983  (in bounds)
//     Ra = 1e10           -0.5520       -0.4958  (in bounds)
//
// The conductive profile stays inside its bounds at BOTH Rayleigh numbers; the
// cold start violates them at both. A D3Q7 scalar near omega = 2 has no
// diffusivity with which to smooth a step, and it does not. So `cond` is the
// default here even though `cold` is what the reference does -- reproducing the
// reference's seed is not worth starting outside the maximum principle. `-ic
// cold` restores it.
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  COLD START: THE SEED GOES IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER, NOT AT MID-DEPTH.
//
//  MEASURED on the Kokkos twin, and it is the reason this is not just `return
//  Tc`. `RbInit` puts its density seed at y = ny/2, which is exactly where the
//  critical mode peaks for a CONDUCTIVE start and is useless for a cold one: a
//  cold start has no gradient anywhere except the diffusing layer at the bottom
//  plate, and that layer is thin --
//
//      delta = sqrt(alpha t) = 2.55 cells at t/t_ff = 7  (H = 498, Ra = 1e11)
//
//  -- so a perturbation at y = 250 sits in NEUTRALLY STRATIFIED fluid with
//  nothing to act on it. On exactly that run the k = 1 mode decayed
//  monotonically, 9.69e-05 -> 6.26e-05 over seven free-fall times with its peak
//  pinned at the seed row the whole way, while the conductive start at the same
//  parameters had it GROWING at 1.51x per free-fall time. For the mid-depth
//  seed to couple, the layer would have to reach 250 cells: 250^2/alpha steps,
//  which never happens inside a run.
//
//  So the cold start seeds the TEMPERATURE where the gradient is:
//
//      T = T_cold + amp dT * exp(-(y-1)/d0) * (1 + sum_k cos(2 pi k x/nx))/2
//
//  d0 = 4 cells, and three properties are deliberate. NON-NEGATIVE: the
//  (1 + cos)/2 form keeps the field inside [T_cold, T_cold + amp dT], so the
//  initial condition does not violate the maximum principle this driver uses as
//  its stop rule. BROADBAND: a cold start's instability belongs to the LAYER
//  and picks its wavelength from delta -- about 2 delta, i.e. five cells here --
//  so seeding one mode of wavelength nx would answer a question the layer is
//  not asking. DETERMINISTIC: two runs with the same flags agree bit for bit.

  //      Ra = 1e11:  worst -0.160 at 42 t_ff, and RECOVERED to [0.005, 0.919]
  //      by the end while convecting (Nu_top 2.7 -> 6.2, max|u| = 0.025).
  //
  //  So the premise this window was first written for -- "a cold start cannot be
  //  run, the stop rule kills it" -- does not hold for the DEFAULT operator. The
  //  -0.552/-0.813 pair belongs to `ScalarBGK`, which relaxes the ghost moments
  //  at the same omega and so reflects rather than damps them at omega -> 2. The
  //  regularised operator annihilates them, and its cold-start excursion is a
  //  fifth of the way to the threshold and transient.
  //
  //  THE WINDOW IS THEREFORE INSURANCE, NOT AN ENABLER, and the useful half of
  //  this change is the REPORT: before it, a run that completed said nothing
  //  about whether it had stayed inside the bounds, which with a cold start is
  //  the first thing you need to know. Now every run ends with the worst
  //  excursion, when it happened, and whether it recovered -- and "RECOVERED, so
  //  treat only the in-bounds tail as data" is a usable instruction where a
  //  silent completion was not.
  //
  //  WHAT IS AND IS NOT RELAXED. Three failures still halt unconditionally, at
  //  any time, because none of them recovers: a non-finite T, a non-finite Nu,
  //  and max|u| > 1. A bounds excursion is the only thing the window touches,
  //  and even then only up to `-slack`; beyond FOUR times the physical range
  //  the run stops whatever the window says, because a D3Q7 scalar smoothing a
  //  step undershoots by a fraction of dT and does not undershoot by 4 dT.
  //
  //  AND NOTHING IS HIDDEN. Every output line still prints T_min and T_max, a
  //  line inside the window that is out of bounds is marked with a `!`, and the
  //  worst excursion of the whole run is reported at the end together with the
  //  time it happened and whether it had recovered by the end. A cold-start run
  //  therefore finishes and SAYS it started outside the bounds, which is more
  //  useful than a run that stops at t = 2 and says the same thing once.
  //
  //  THE DEFAULT COMES FROM DIFFUSION, NOT FROM TASTE. The undershoot is the
  //  scalar failing to resolve a step, so it decays as the step does: the layer
  //  thickens as delta = sqrt(alpha t), and the excursion is gone once delta
  //  covers several cells. Taking four cells,
  //
  //      t_smooth = 16 / alpha   steps  =  16 / (alpha t_ff)  free-fall times,
  //
  //  and the window is EXACTLY that, printed at startup so it can be checked
  //  rather than trusted: the halt is suppressed for precisely as long as the
  //  step is still sharper than four cells, and not one free-fall time longer.
  //  The first version used 4x t_smooth, which is padding with no argument
  //  behind it, and the padding is what did the damage -- at H = 498,
  //  Ra = 1e11, tf = 100 the step smooths in 17 t_ff, comfortably 17% of the
  //  run, yet 4x17 = 69 t_ff tripped the refusal below and the message then
  //  blamed the physics for a multiplier this file had chosen. A window with a
  //  meaning beats a window with a safety factor.
  //
  //  It is ZERO for `cond`, which starts inside its bounds and should still be
  //  held to them from step 0. `-grace` overrides either way, and `-grace 0`
  //  restores the old behaviour exactly.
  //
  //  A WINDOW IS ONLY LEGITIMATE IF THE EXCURSION IS ACTUALLY TRANSIENT, and
  //  whether it is depends on the parameters, not on the scheme. t_smooth
  //  carries 1/alpha while the run carries t_ff, so
  //
  //      t_smooth / run  =  16 sqrt(Pr Ra) / (H^2 tf)
  //
  //      H = 998,  Ra = 1e11,  tf = 200    t_smooth =  4.3 t_ff     2% of the run
  //      H = 50,   Ra = 1e14,  tf = 1e4    t_smooth = 5.4e4 t_ff   540% of the run
  //
  //  At the reference's own point the step NEVER smooths: alpha is so small that
  //  the temperature field is still a discontinuity when the run ends, so the
  //  undershoot is PERMANENT and halting on it is correct. So when the derived
  //  window would exceed a quarter of the run the answer is not to shorten the
  //  window -- it is to REFUSE it and set it to zero. Capping it to a quarter of
  //  the run was the first version of this and it was wrong in the worst
  //  available direction: it printed "the halt is right" while suppressing that
  //  halt for 2500 free-fall times. A window that outlives the transient it
  //  exists for is a disabled stop rule wearing a justification.
  //
  //  So: `-ic cold` runs where the step smooths and is refused where it does
  //  not, with the arithmetic printed either way. `-grace` overrides, because
  //  someone deliberately reproducing the reference's divergence needs to be
  //  able to; that is an explicit choice on the command line rather than a
  //  default.
