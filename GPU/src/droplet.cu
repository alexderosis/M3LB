//==============================================================================
//  A static droplet: Laplace's law for the colour-gradient model.
//
//  THE CANONICAL TEST OF A SURFACE-TENSION MODEL, and the one that decides
//  whether the perturbation coefficient is right. A sphere of red in blue,
//  seeded at rest with a tanh profile and left alone. In three dimensions
//
//      dp = 2 sigma / R,
//
//  so the measured tension is 0.5 (p_in - p_out) R, and it is compared against
//  the sigma the model was ASKED for through sigma = 2 A tau / 9, Eq. (D14).
//  Getting the perturbation coefficient wrong by a factor of two halves the
//  answer here and changes nothing else in the model, which is exactly why this
//  case exists. NOTE this driver takes -sigma and never names A: it reaches it
//  through ColourModel::A_from_sigma(), which is why the 2026-09-19 change of
//  convention (Saito's sigma = 4 A tau / 9 to Eq. (D14)'s 2 A tau / 9) required
//  no edit here at all. A driver that set A by hand would have needed one.
//
//  THE PRESSURE IS p = sum_k rho_k cs_k^2, Eq. (26), each phase with its own
//  alpha. That is the same combination the equilibrium's rest term carries, and
//  the one that makes the pure-phase balance of Eq. (25) hold.
//
//  THE AVERAGING WINDOW EXCLUDES THREE INTERFACE WIDTHS, NOT ONE, and at a large
//  density ratio that is not conservatism. cs_b^2 is gamma times cs_r^2, so a
//  trace of the LIGHT fluid inside the droplet is weighted gamma-fold against
//  the heavy fluid it sits in. At R = 12, W = 4 the seeded profile still holds
//  rho_b = 0.018 at r = R - W, contributing 6e-3 to the pressure against a
//  Laplace jump of 5.9e-5 -- a hundred times the quantity being measured.
//
//  -window changes that gap, in units of W, and the default stays 3. It exists
//  so this driver and bubble.cu can be measured THE SAME WAY when the two
//  models are compared: bubble.cu justifies 2 on its own error structure, and
//  a comparison run must not let the measurement differ along with the model.
//
//  THE SEEDED INTERFACE WAS TWICE TOO WIDE UNTIL THIS COMMIT, and it is worth
//  recording because everything else about the driver was right. The paper's
//  Eqs. (41)-(42) seed tanh[2(r - R)/W]; this file had tanh[(r - R)/W]. The
//  parent's validation/static_droplet.cpp has the 2, and so does bubble.cu next
//  door, so -w 4 here bought an interface no other part of the tree agreed with.
//
//  It hid because a wrong interface width is still a CONSISTENT simulation. The
//  device reproduced the host to every digit, the equilibrium and perturbation
//  identities all held, sigma converged to a steady value -- nothing was
//  inconsistent, only wrong, and the one number that could have shown it was
//  read as a property of the model:
//
//      gamma     parent      this file, 2x wide     this file, fixed
//        1       0.87%           -2.48%                 +0.94%
//       10       0.77%           -3.02%                 +0.67%
//      100         --           -13.61%                 -3.36%
//
//  The GPU port was quietly 3x worse than the code it was ported from at
//  gamma = 1, and that gap sat in the README as an open question about the
//  model rather than being chased. It was the seed.
//
//  EVERY NUMBER IN THE TABLE ABOVE PREDATES THE APPENDIX D PORT (2026-09-19) and
//  was measured with Saito et al.'s third-order equilibrium, the per-colour rest
//  term as the only reading, and sigma = 4 A tau / 9. The model changed under
//  them; they are kept because the SEED bug they diagnose is real and the
//  diagnosis still stands, but they are not this driver's current output and
//  must not be quoted as such.
//
//  WHAT THE PARENT MEASURES NOW, converged at 32000 steps, 48^3 / R=16 / tau=1:
//  gamma = 1 0.88%, gamma = 10 0.68%, gamma = 20 0.46%, gamma = 100 3.21%.
//  gamma <= 20 is already there by 8000 steps (0.04 points of drift); gamma =
//  100 is not, reading 2.12% at 8000 and 3.11% at 16000 before it settles.
//  AT gamma = 1000 THE DROPLET COMES APART: the
//  measured Laplace jump crosses zero (+4.84e-3, +1.20e-3, -2.34e-4 at
//  8000/16000/32000) while the interface widens from 4.92 to 5.47 cells. That is
//  a qualitative failure, not a slow transient, and it is unexplained.
//
//  THE STEP COUNT HAS TO SCALE WITH GAMMA. A ladder quoted at one fixed step
//  count across a gamma sweep is meaningless here -- the parent's first attempt
//  read 493% at gamma = 100 purely because 1500 steps was nowhere near the
//  relaxation time. Check the series is flat before reading a number off it.
//
//  Runs on the host with no GPU, at a smaller grid:
//     c++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Iinclude -x c++ src/droplet.cu -o droplet
