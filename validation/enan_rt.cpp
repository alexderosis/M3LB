//==============================================================================
//  De Rosis & Enan, Phys. Fluids 33, 043315 (2021), Sec. III H and I -- the
//  Rayleigh-Taylor instability in two and three dimensions, against their
//  Tables VIII and IX and their Fig. 11.
//
//  This is the second group of their Sec. III: two immiscible fluids, both the
//  velocity and the order parameter solved. Unlike the interface-capture tests
//  of validation/enan_interface.cpp, a fluid collision operator IS exercised
//  here, and it is the central-moment one on D3Q27 throughout -- for the
//  two-dimensional cases too, run with a single periodic cell in z. The paper
//  uses D3Q19, which this tree does not carry -- and would not run the
//  multiphase central-moment operator anyway, since it is D3Q27 minus its
//  corners and so has no product basis. Stated rather than worked around.
//
//  SETUP, theirs exactly. A box W wide and 4W tall, heavy fluid above light,
//  periodic across and no-slip top and bottom, with the interface given a
//  single-mode perturbation:
//
//      2-D, Eq. (81):  y_i = 2W + 0.10 W cos(2 pi x / W)
//      3-D, Eq. (83):  y_i = 2W + 0.05 W [cos(2 pi x / W) + cos(2 pi z / W)]
//
//  so the spike starts at y = 1.9 W in both, which is what their tables report
//  at t = 0 (1.900 and 1.898). Gravity is set by sqrt(g W) = 0.04, the
//  Reynolds number is Re = W sqrt(g W) / nu, the Atwood number At = 0.5 with
//  rho_L = 1, and time is reported in units of t0 = sqrt(W / (g At)).
//
//  The reported quantity is the paper's y-dagger: the vertical position of the
//  SPIKE -- the lowest point the heavy fluid has reached -- divided by W, so it
//  runs downward from 1.9.
//
//  WHAT THE PAPER DOES NOT STATE, and it matters. The interface width is given
//  nowhere for these cases. Sec. III's "unless otherwise stated we adopt
//  M = 0.001, n = 3" is scoped to the first group, where the mobility is set by
//  a Peclet number anyway; here Pe is given (500, 1000, 500 and 1024) but the
//  width that closes Pe = U xi / M is not. xi = 3 is used, and -iw sweeps it,
//  because a number quoted from an unstated parameter should come with the
//  sensitivity to it.
//
//  The rest follows from their groups: nu = W U / Re with U = sqrt(gW), the
//  surface tension from Ca = mu_H U / sigma, and the mobility from Pe.
//
//  HYDROSTATIC INITIALISATION, THROUGH THE DIFFUSE INTERFACE. The pressure is
//  seeded by integrating the ACTUAL density profile away from the interface
//  rather than assuming a sharp one; demonstrator/rayleigh_taylor.cpp's banner
//  records what assuming sharp costs at a high density ratio. At At = 0.5 the
//  imbalance would be small, but the closed form is free and the same code runs
//  at any At.
//
//  WHAT THIS TEST CAN AND CANNOT SETTLE. A nonlinear instability has no closed
//  form, so this is a comparison against other people's numbers and not a proof
//  of anything. The paper's Table IX puts eight models beside each other and
//  they spread by 30 % at t/t0 = 3 -- 0.648 to 0.863 -- so agreement inside that
//  spread says the scheme belongs in the same family, and nothing sharper. The
//  spread is printed alongside for exactly that reason.
//
//  RESOLUTION IS THE FIRST THING TO CHECK, AND W = 64 IS NOT ENOUGH HERE. On
//  their Table VIII (2-D, Re = 30000, Ca = 0.26) with only W varied, the worst
//  deviation over the seven tabulated instants is
//
//      W = 64    15.8 %
//      W = 128    4.9 %
//      W = 256    2.7 %
//
//  and in every case the error is LATE: the first five instants agree to about
//  1 % at all three resolutions and the whole deficit appears at t/t0 = 2.5 and
//  3, once the spike has rolled up and the structure that has to be resolved is
//  the filament rather than the interface. So the scheme converges, and a
//  disagreement at t/t0 = 3 on a coarse grid is the expected behaviour rather
//  than a defect to hunt.
//
//  SURFACE TENSION DOES NOTHING ON ITS OWN -- it only sharpens the resolution
//  requirement, and the first version of this note got that wrong. At W = 64,
//  Re = 30000, changing ONLY Ca from 0.26 to 960 -- sigma from 1.58e-4 to
//  1.25e-6 -- takes the worst deviation from 15.8 % to 29.3 %, which reads like
//  an independent penalty. It is not. The SAME change at W = 256 gives 1.9 %
//  against 2.7 %, i.e. very slightly BETTER. A nearly surface-tension-free
//  interface simply needs more cells to carry the filament; given them, it
//  costs nothing. Their 3-D
//  cases run at Ca = 960 AND W = 64, so they sit at the bad end of both knobs
//  at once, and their 92.8 % is not a single cause. It is also not fully
//  accounted for: the 2-D equivalent of those settings gives 29.3 %, so
//  something 3-D-specific remains, and it is left open rather than guessed at.
//
//  WHAT IT IS NOT is the spike measure, and that was worth ruling out rather
//  than assuming. "Position of the spike" is the tip of the coherent finger,
//  while a global minimum over phi > 0.5 is a different quantity as soon as
//  anything detaches -- and Ca = 960 is a surface tension of 1.25e-6, exactly
//  the regime where an interface fragments freely. In 3-D the global scan also
//  covers 64x more nodes per y-level than in 2-D, so one stray cell is far
//  likelier to capture it. All three measures below therefore run side by side,
//  and on the 3-D Re = 256 case they agree TO THE DIGIT at every one of the
//  seven tabulated instants, 0.0469 at t/t0 = 3 included. No fragmentation, no
//  stray cells: the finger really does reach the floor, and the deficit is
//  physics. The measures are kept because the hypothesis was reasonable and
//  the next person will have it too.
