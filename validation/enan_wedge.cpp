//==============================================================================
//  Vertical penetration of a wedge -- De Rosis & Enan, Phys. Fluids 33, 043315
//  (2021), Sec. III.G -- against Wagner's slamming theory.
//
//  A symmetric wedge of deadrise angle phi is driven DOWN into quiescent water
//  at a constant speed v, and the vertical force on it is compared with the
//  potential-flow result Wagner (1932) obtained for the same problem,
//
//      F_W(t) = rho_H pi^2 v^2 a(t) / (4 tan phi),   a(t) = pi v t / (2 tan phi)
//
//  a(t) being the wetted half-width. Those combine to
//
//      F_W(t) = rho_H pi^3 v^3 t / (8 tan^2 phi),
//
//  which is LINEAR IN TIME, and that linearity is most of the test: it is a
//  statement the simulation can fail in a way no fitted constant can hide.
//
//  IT NEEDS NO UNIT CONVERSION, which is worth saying because the paper states
//  this case in metres and seconds -- water at 1000 kg/m^3, a 1 m semi-wedge at
//  1 m/s. Normalising by rho_H v^2 b and tau = v t / b,
//
//      F* = F / (rho_H v^2 b) = pi^3 tau / (8 tan^2 phi),
//
//  so the whole comparison is a dimensionless slope that depends on nothing but
//  the deadrise angle. The case runs in lattice units and is scored on that
//  slope. Nothing here converts metres.
//
//  WHY PENALISATION AND NOT AN IMMERSED BOUNDARY. The paper uses a Peskin IBM.
//  This tree has volume penalisation instead, and PenalisedBody.hpp's banner
//  argues the substitution at length: for a body whose interior moves rigidly
//  it enforces the same condition, keeps the pose continuous rather than
//  lattice-quantised, and needs no refill scheme. What it costs is surface
//  accuracy, which is exactly where a slamming pressure lives, so the apex
//  rounding recorded in that banner is the first thing to suspect if the
//  shallow-deadrise runs disagree.
//
//  THREE PLACES THIS IS NOT THEIR CASE, and all three are chosen rather than
//  overlooked:
//
//  1. THE DENSITY RATIO. Water over air is 1000/1.225 = 816. The phase field
//     here is characterised to about 100 (see CLAUDE.md and the multiphase
//     banner), so -ratio defaults to 100 and the paper's 816 is available but
//     not the default. Slamming is a water-side phenomenon and Wagner does not
//     model the air at all, so the expectation is that the force is insensitive
//     to this; -ratio exists so that the expectation is measured rather than
//     assumed, and the sweep is what the PASS is conditioned on.
//  2. GRAVITY IS OFF by default. Wagner's solution has none, and over the
//     impact time the hydrostatic contribution is a separate additive term
//     rather than part of the slamming force. -g turns it on.
//  3. WAGNER IS ASYMPTOTIC in small phi and in early time. It holds while the
//     spray root is still on the wedge face, a(t) < b, i.e.
//
//         tau < 2 tan(phi) / pi,
//
//     which is a SHORT window -- 0.23 at 20 degrees. The fit is taken inside
//     it, and the run continues past it only so the departure is visible.
//     The paper says its own agreement improves as phi falls, for this reason.

  // THE WEDGE IS ALREADY MOVING WHEN IT TOUCHES THE WATER, and starting it on

  // that has nothing to do with slamming: measured, it put F* = 35.8 at the
  // instant of contact against a Wagner value of 0 there and about 7 at the
  // end of the window, so the transient was five times the signal and the
  // force DECAYED through the window instead of growing. It also rings, because
  // an impulsive start in a weakly compressible method launches an acoustic
  // pulse.
  //
  // So the wedge is released `drop` cells above the undisturbed surface, falls
  // through air -- which is 1/ratio of the density and contributes almost
  // nothing -- and tau is measured from the step at which the apex CROSSES the
  // surface, which is where Wagner's a(t) starts from zero.
  //
  // THE DROP MUST ALSO OUTLAST THE ACOUSTIC PULSE, and that is a second
  // requirement rather than the same one. Released 20 cells up at b = 80 the
  // force rises cleanly to F* = 5.84 and then COLLAPSES to 1.29 and recovers,
  // in the middle of the fit window -- which reads exactly like the spray root
  // doing something physical and is not. Changing only the drop settles it:

  //
  // Same impact, same window, same everything else. The collapse is the
  // startup pulse from the impulsive release coming back around a periodic
  // domain, and at the longer drop it has dispersed before touchdown. A
