//==============================================================================
//  Channel flow in PHYSICAL units -- 5 m x 1 m x 1 m, water, parabolic inlet.
//
//  A rectangular duct, length 5 m along x, height 1 m along y, breadth 1 m
//  along z. No-slip on the two y-normal planes, a fixed parabolic profile on
//  the west face, a constant back-pressure outflow on the east face, periodic
//  in z. The fluid is water (nu = 1.0e-6 m^2/s, rho = 1000 kg/m^3).
//
//  This is the one case in the tree that starts from METRES AND SECONDS and
//  carries the conversion out in the open, so it doubles as a worked example of
//  the "From a physical problem to lattice units" section of CLAUDE.md. The
//  conversion is the velocity-capping strategy: u_lat is chosen, which fixes
//  dt = u_lat * dx / u_phys, and omega follows. nu_lat is then computed twice --
//  once as nu_phys * dt / dx^2 and once as u_lat * N / Re -- and the two are
//  printed side by side. They are algebraically identical, so a mismatch means
//  the conversion has been edited wrongly, not that the physics is interesting.
//
//  WHAT THE FLOW IS. The inlet profile is the fully developed solution, so the
//  exact answer is that same parabola at every station:
//
//      ux(y) = 4 U (y/H) (1 - y/H),     dp/dx = -8 mu U / H^2.
//
//  Both are checked: the profile at the mid-section, and the streamwise density
//  gradient, which in lattice units is drho/dx = (dp/dx)_lat / cs2.
//
//  THE REYNOLDS NUMBER IS THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY. u_phys = 1 m/s in a 1 m channel
//  of water is Re = u H / nu = 1.0e6. Plane Poiseuille is linearly unstable
//  from Re ~ 5772 and transitions in practice near Re ~ 2000, and there is no
//  turbulence model in this tree, so the laminar parabola is NOT the physical
//  answer there -- it is the answer to the equations being solved. A run at
//  Re = 1.0e6 is therefore an under-resolved laminar computation, and it is
//  reported as such. Re is a command-line parameter precisely so the same case
//  can be run at a Re where the parabola IS the physics.
//
//  CONVERGENCE: THE SCALING DECIDES WHAT IS BEING MEASURED. This channel has a
//  fixed PHYSICAL aspect ratio, 5:1, so Nx grows with N and the density variation
//  along it does NOT shrink under refinement. Refining at fixed u0 therefore
//  measures the compressibility error, not the scheme:
//
//    u0      fitted rate   A (2nd-order coeff)   floor B     B / finest err
//    0.02      0.865         0.521               9.48e-4        0.78
//    0.005     1.888         0.589               2.49e-5        0.17
//
//  A is the same in both -- it belongs to the scheme -- while the non-refining
//  floor B falls ~50x for a 4x smaller u0, which is steeper than u0^2. The
//  exponent is NOT claimed: poiseuille_inlet.cpp declines to pin it from a
//  two-point extraction and there is no more information here.
//
//  Under DIFFUSIVE scaling -- tau held fixed, so u0 = (tau-1/2) cs2 Re / N falls
//  as 1/N and the Mach error falls as 1/N^2, the same rate as discretisation --
//  the ladder measures the order of the scheme and no floor appears at all
//  (fitted B < 0). That is the scaling to use for a convergence claim here.
//
//  Note that poiseuille_inlet.cpp holds Lx = 21 FIXED while Ly grows, so its
//  aspect ratio shrinks and its compressibility error falls as 1/Ly^2. Its
//  fitted floor at the same U0 = 0.02 is 2.1e-5, 50x below the one above. Both
//  numbers are right; the geometries are not comparable.
//
//  INITIALISATION IS NOT A DETAIL. From rest, the transient is momentum
//  diffusion across the channel, tau_d = N^2 / nu_lat = N Re / u_lat steps --
//  4e8 steps at N = 9, Re = 1e6, u_lat = 0.02. That is not affordable and it is
//  not what a high-Re run can test anyway. So -init parabola seeds the exact
//  solution and asks whether the scheme MAINTAINS it, which probes the wall,
//  inlet and outlet closures but not the evolution. -init rest is the stronger
//  test and is the one to use at moderate Re; the clock then printed as
//  t/tau_d is the one that matters, and a run that stops below 2 is not
//  converged whatever the residual says (see validation/poiseuille_inlet.cpp,
//  which measured a run quitting at 0.03 tau_d with a 400x error).
