#  DO THE MOMENT ARRAYS STAY IN REGISTERS?  A stack-frame measurement on the
#  collision operators, from compiler output rather than from a stopwatch.
#
#  WHY THIS IS A SHELL SCRIPT AND NOT A ctest CASE. What it measures -- frame
#  bytes, whether a loop survived, whether an array is subscripted by a register
#  -- is a property of one compiler on one architecture. Asserting a NUMBER
#  would be brittle enough to be deleted within a month. So this prints a table
#  and leaves the judgement to a reader, and the header of MomentCollision.hpp
#  records the numbers that were current when the finding was made.
#
#  WHAT TO LOOK FOR, in order of how much it matters:
#
#    regidx > 0   an array is indexed by a REGISTER. If it is a local array
#                 this is the bad case: the compiler could not prove the index
#                 constant, so the array cannot live in registers AT ANY
#                 register budget. Check what the index is before calling it a
#                 defect -- a genuine per-node field load looks the same and is
#                 fine (`[x9, w3, sxtw #2]` with w3 the Index argument).
#    loops > 0    a loop over the moments survived. Every such loop keeps its
#                 induction variable at runtime, which is what stops the
#                 basis's 432-byte Ord table from folding.
#    frame        after the two above are clean, this is ordinary register
#                 pressure: 72 doubles do not fit arm64's 32 FP registers and
#                 the compiler spills some at constant offsets. A GPU thread has
#                 up to 255 registers, so a frame that is only pressure may
#                 vanish on a device where a runtime-indexed one cannot.
#
#  Reference table, clang -O3, arm64, 2026-09-04.  frame bytes / loops / regidx:
#
#      operator                   FP64 before   FP64 after  FP32 before  FP32 after
#      BGK                           0 / 2 /10   (untouched)   0 / 1 / 6  (untouched)
#      MomentCollision             464 / 1 / 4   368 / 0 / 0  320 / 1 / 4  224 / 0 / 0
#      MultiphaseCentralMoments    400 / 1 / 5   400 / 0 / 1  336 / 1 / 4  256 / 0 / 1
#      PhaseFieldCentralMoments    656 / 1 / 1   (untouched)  432 / 0 / 0  (untouched)
#      ColourGradient             1200 / 1 /10   (untouched)  624 / 0 / 6  (untouched)
#
#  The two fixed operators lost their surviving loop and all of their
#  register-indexed LOCAL accesses at both precisions. The one regidx left in
#  MultiphaseCentralMoments is a genuine per-node field load, not a demoted
#  array -- it reads `[x9, w3, sxtw #2]` with w3 the Index argument.
#
#  BGK's own loops and regidx are its walk over f[i], a caller-provided pointer.
#  Its frame is zero at both precisions, which is the contrast that matters.
#
#  TWO STILL OPEN, both recorded rather than half-fixed:
#
#  ColourGradient carries the largest frame in the tree, and it is the operator
#  whose GPU/ sibling was measured at 47x BGK (20.2 against 950 MLUPS) and
#  recovered 12.5x by deriving the equilibrium central moments in closed form.
#  Its `ke`/`kp` arrays need that same derivation rather than the loop unrolling
#  that fixed the other two, and that is a change with its own accuracy
#  consequences.
#
#  PhaseFieldCentralMoments keeps a loop at FP64 but not at FP32, on the same
#  source -- so it is the register budget deciding whether to unroll, not an
#  indexing failure. Its regidx of 1 is a field load, as above. Left alone: the
#  moment loops there are `k[n] = 0` and `k[n] = r[n]`, which carry no table
#  lookup, so there is nothing for the fix in MomentCollision.hpp to remove.
