//==============================================================================
//  Urban pollutant dispersion.
//
//  A passive scalar released into a city, transported by an atmospheric wind
//  over building geometry read from a height field. This is the Pollutant
//  project's D3Q7 stage, rebuilt on the validated solver: the same physics, the
//  same output format, but the transport, the walls and -- the part that did not
//  previously exist -- the OPEN BOUNDARIES are the ones validated in
//  validation/gaussian_plume.cpp and validation/scalar_walls.cpp.
//
//  A DEMONSTRATOR, NOT A VALIDATION CASE, and the distinction matters here more
//  than usual. There is no analytic solution for a plume in a real city and no
//  measurement to compare against, so nothing in this file can fail except by
//  crashing. What can be checked is checked, and reported as a number:
//    * the wind's divergence, which bounds the error it injects (see below);
//    * whether the scalar has reached steady state, as dM/dt;
//    * the fraction of the release still inside the domain.
//
//  THE WIND IS PRESCRIBED, AND THAT IS THE MODEL'S MAIN LIMITATION.
//  u(z) = (u*/kappa) ln((z+z0)/z0) is a neutral-stability surface layer, simply
//  zeroed inside buildings. It has no street-canyon recirculation, no building
//  wake and no channelling along avenues -- which are exactly the phenomena an
//  urban dispersion study is about.
//
//  HOW NOT TO MEASURE THAT. A log profile zeroed inside buildings is not
//  divergence-free, and it is tempting to look for the damage in a mass budget.
//  That budget cannot see it. Bounce-back is conservative and sum_i w_i c_i = 0,
//  so the advective term contributes nothing to sum_i h_i: the budget closes to
//  round-off however wrong the wind is. Here it is worse still, because the
//  outflow condition of ScalarSolver PRESCRIBES its cells rather than conserving
//  them, so "what left the domain" is not an independent quantity at all -- it
//  is injected minus stored, by construction.
//
//  The error appears in the CONCENTRATION instead. Expanding the transport term,
//  div(uC) = u.grad(C) + C div(u), and the second piece is spurious: it
//  concentrates the scalar where div(u) < 0 and dilutes it where div(u) > 0. So
//  div(u) is the diagnostic, reported below over the open cells and separately
//  over the cells next to a wall, where the zeroing bites hardest. Those numbers
//  are the quantitative case for replacing this wind with a solved one.
//
//  CHECKED AGAINST THE ORIGINAL, AND WHERE THE TWO DIVERGE. On the synthetic
//  60x30x20 case both codes agree exactly on dt (0.0129 s), tau (0.5646) and
//  every div(u) figure -- RMS 1.063e-3 over open cells, 9.213e-3 over
//  wall-adjacent cells, max 1.867e-2 -- so the wind, the scaling and the
//  geometry are the same problem. Along the plume centreline the concentrations
//  agree to within 0.8% through the interior.
//
//  They part company at the outflow, and it is worth recording which one is
//  wrong. Steady-state mass here is 11.4% higher than the original's, entirely
//  in the cells near an open face: 12.5% of the field lies within three cells of
//  one, against 5.9% there. Measuring the advective flux through successive
//  planes settles it. In the original that flux falls 52% between x = 30 and the
//  last cell, dropping from 0.82 to 0.48 of its reference value across a SINGLE
//  cell; here it rises 7.6% over the same span. A steady state cannot destroy
//  half its flux at a boundary, so the original's exit is an artificial sink: it
//  discards outgoing populations and supplies no incoming ones, starving the
//  last cell and pulling material out diffusively for some distance upstream.
//
//  The 7.6% rise is not error either, or not all of it. The wind is sheared, so
//  scalar mixing upward into faster-moving air genuinely increases u.C through
//  successive planes while the TOTAL flux, advective plus diffusive, is what is
//  conserved. The condition used here was measured against a case with no shear
//  and an analytic answer -- validation/gaussian_plume.cpp -- where it holds the
//  flux to 0.038% all the way to the last interior cell.

    // condition and the initial state; the interior is solved, so the flow
    // separates behind buildings and channels along streets instead of passing
    // through them as if they were porous.
    //
    // The payoff is not realism for its own sake -- it is that a solved field is
    // divergence-free to round-off, which removes the spurious C div(u) source
    // entirely, and with it both the concentration error reported above and the
    // stability floor on the diffusivity.
    //
    // Same Domain, same dx, same dt, so the fluid's lattice velocity IS the
    // scalar's lattice velocity and the two couple with no conversion. That is
    // the module composition the whole design is for.
    //
    // *** INCOMPLETE. READ THIS BEFORE USING -mode solved. ***
    //
    // The interior is right and is the point: three cells clear of every face,
    // div u falls from RMS 1.27e-3 (prescribed) to 2.12e-4, and the peak speed
    // is 8.8 m/s against a 7.7 m/s free stream -- a 14% speed-up over the
    // building, which is the physical result the prescribed profile cannot
    // produce at all.
    //
    // The domain EDGES are not right. Where the pressure outlet meets the
    // velocity-prescribed lateral and top faces, the corner is over-determined,
    // and a jet forms along it: 31.6 m/s and div u of 9.5e-2, against 8.8 m/s
    // and 7.0e-3 in the interior. Giving those edges the free stream (below)
    // removed the inert-outflow-node warning but did NOT remove the jet, so the
    // cause is the mixed condition itself and not the donor lookup.
    //
    // The identified fix is periodic lateral boundaries -- the standard
    // atmospheric setup, which deletes two of the four offending faces outright
    // and leaves only the outlet/top edge. It is not done here because the
    // Domain is shared with the scalar, for which periodic laterals mean a
    // plume leaving one side re-enters the other, and that is a modelling
    // decision rather than a bug fix.
    //
    // Until then: the field is usable away from the boundary, the plume must
    // not be allowed to reach the outlet edges, and -mode prescribed remains
    // the default.
    // -mode unsteady is -mode solved that never stops solving: the flow is spun
    // up for -flow-steps and then advanced ONE STEP PER SCALAR STEP, so the
    // plume is carried by the instantaneous field rather than a frozen mean.

    // Those two cities have the SAME peak divergence to two per cent, and the
    // max-based margin puts a stable run and a divergent one eleven per cent
    // apart -- it cannot separate them, and using it to set a threshold means
    // drawing a line through the middle of a coin flip. The RMS separates the
    // same pair by a factor of 2.9.
    //
    // Which makes sense. The spurious source is damped at the cell scale by
    // D_lat pi^2, so a single bad cell is held down by diffusion from its
    // neighbours; what outruns diffusion is an EXTENDED region of divergence,
    // and how much of the domain is in that state is what the RMS measures and
    // the max does not. The decomposition is exact and worth knowing:
    //
    //     RMS over open cells = sqrt(wall-adjacent fraction) x RMS at walls
    //
    // (0.112 x 8.216e-3 for Manchester, 0.183 x 1.329e-2 for Manhattan, both to
    // three figures), so this really is "how much city", not "how bad is the
    // worst cell". Manhattan has 4.3 times as many wall-adjacent cells.
    //
    // The threshold below is 100x, which sits just under the lowest verified
    // stable point and well above the one failure. It is calibrated on ONE
    // failure and should be treated as such: it is a warning, not a proof. Both
    // margins are printed, because the max is still worth seeing.
    //
    // Note that D_lat = D_phys u_lat_max / (u_peak dx) has no dt in it, so
    // shortening the time step does NOT buy margin -- only a larger
